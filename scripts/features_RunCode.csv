The lines from this excerpt that suggest that Mr. Darcy is questioning his hasty judgment and has fallen in love with Elizabeth are the following one: ""But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes."" This is the moment he realized that he was wrong about her and that there is more to her than he originally thought. He realized that he has already fallen in love with her, despite her flaws.

No slavery wasn't a choice... 

Many slaves were beaten if they rebelled or tried to get their own rights. Children were born into slavery meaning that that's all the knew. Most owners didn't teach their slaves to read or write, so slaves couldn't easily survive on their own because they weren't educated enough to get a job.

The civil war showed how slaves didn't have a choice or rights even though they desperately wanted them, and even after the war their was segregation. Slaves didn't have a choice or a voice.

The hummingbird's nutritional needs daily are 10,000 mg of sugar and 8,000 mg of protein. 

Since one nasturtium flower provides 10 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 1000 nasturtium flowers each day for its nutritional needs (10,000/10 = 1000). 
Since one honeysuckle flower provides 20 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 500 honeysuckle flowers each day for its nutritional needs. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on nasturtium flowers, then the bird will need 5,000 seconds to get exactly the food it needs. This is calculated based on the information that it takes 5 seconds to feed on a nasturtium: 1000 flowers daily * 5 seconds = 5000 sec = 83,3 min. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on honeysuckle flowers, then the bird will need: 500 flowers * 20 seconds = 10,000 sec = 166,6 min.

You can look at this problem step by step. 
First step: Probability that the first pick is male = 10/20   (as 10 males out of 20 people)
2nd step: Probability that the second pick is male= 9/19 (as there are 9 males left out of 19 people) 
3rd step: P = 8/18
4th step: P = 7/17

As these all need to happen once you need to multiply the probabilities. 

The result is: 10/20 * 9/19 * 8/18 * 7/17
You can simplify this if you wish.

Since it is geometric sequence, we know that a₄ = a₁ r³ and a₆ = a₁ r⁵

So we have a₆ / a₄ = a₁ r⁵ / a₁ r³ = r²

Also a₆ / a₄ = 64 / 16 = 4

So r would be either 2 or -2. Let's go with 2 for now.

Now let's find a₁.

a₄ / r = a₃ = 16 / 2 = 8

a₃ / r = a₂ = 8 / 2 = 4

a₂ / r = a₁ = 4 /2 = 2

So S₄ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30

So final answer: S₄ = 30

The correct answer is a response. 

According to the communication process theory, a response refers to the impact or call to action that occurs as a result of a being subject to a message such as a television advertisement. In this instance, the ad about Claritin had an impact on Ann, leading her to immediately go to to a pharmacy to purchase it.

Mean is the same thing as average
example
the mean of 30 and 40 is 35 because (30+40)/2=70/2=35

mean absolue deviation is when you take the mean of the set
then you find the diffference of each number of the set then take the mean of that
ex if yo uhave 1,2,3,4,5 and the mean is 3, then ou find the absolute value of the difference of each
|1-3|=2
|2-3|=1
|3-3|=0
|4-3|=1
|5-3|=2
add them and divide by 5
(2+1+0+1+2)/5=6/5= MAD=6/5

basically it tells how spread out the graph is or how close the points are to the mean
so the smaller mean average deviation, the closer the points are to the mean
the bigger it is, the farther they are

so if they had the points 1,2,3,4,5 and mean is 3 and MAD=6/5, 6/5 is small so therefor the points are close to that number
if I had the points 1,1,1,2,5,5 and the mean was 3 and MAD=11/5, 11/5 is bigger than 6/5 and therefor the points are more spread out


therefor the math scores are closer togeher
science is farther apart

if you mean that the highest grade in math was compared witht eh highest grade in science, then science is higher since the plots are more spread out

since math had a smaller MAD than science, the points are closer together

so the answers are C and D

Painted area= 

Now, to find rate, in square feet per hour, we are going to divide the painted area by the number of hours: 
Rate=

We can conclude that Kyler paints at a rate of 434.78 square feet per hour.

Let us go over every choice:
D) D is incorrect; Neanderthals were a hominid species and a relatively advanced one since they lived very closely in time to homo sapiens (modern man). Neanderthals used to live in Europe and had been living there before modern man came from Africa.
C) This is not precise. While it could have been used as a weapon, nowhere in the passage can we see a hint for that. It might have helped modern humans in other ways, making them more reliably survive cold periods and thus displacing the resident Neanderthals.
B) This is also not precise. While the passage implies that fire might have been an important factor for the migration, quite possibly there could be other important aspects of migration to learn. Also, the passage says ""may have helped"", it is not too definitive.
A) THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. The only concrete fact of the passage is the fact that Neandertals went extinct after the arrival of the modern man. The passage in whole is arguing that since fire is so important in Europe and the Neanderthals did not have access to it, we could attribute their extinction to the modern humans having fire as a competitive advantage.

Among these bills, you can pick up
the Social Security Act for sure. This particular one entails the minimum
amount of purchasing capacity that beneficiaries from this policy can take
advantage of (crucial government decision to set up the economic virtuous
circle). Moving on, you can also pick the Stock Market Security Act. Given the
financial mayhem taken place in Wall Street by the later 20’s, the U.S. corresponding

The answer is ""Max adopted a professional persona for his job interview.""

For the specialist Carl Jung, the persona, was the social face an individual presents to the world. It resembles a cover to establish a connection upon others and to hide the genuine idea of the person. For Max's situation, he just needs to extend his expert side and not the his actual loose side.

Concentration refers to how much of a chemical is present in a given solution. 

Consider two beakers with 200cm^3 of water. One has 10g of salt, the other one has 50g of salt. The beaker with the 50g of salt is more concentrated/has a higher concentration because there is much more of the solute in the same amount of solvent.

 Here Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B.

It takes 1.58 seconds.

The equation to represent this is of the form h(t) = -16t²+v₀t+h₀, where -16 is the gravitational constant, v₀ is the initial velocity, and h₀ is the initial height.  We do not have an initial velocity, since the balloon is dropped.  The initial height is 40.  This gives us the function
h(t) = -16t² + 40.

We will set this equal to 0:
0 = -16t² + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides:
0-40 = -16t² + 40 - 40
-40 = -16t²

Divide both sides by -16:
-40/-16 = -16t²/-16
2.5 = t²

Take the square root of both sides:
√2.5 = √t²
1.58 = t

Let x and y be the rate per hour for Mechanic 1 and 2 respectively.

Then,
x+y=205 ---------- (1)
Additionally,
10x+15y = 2500 ------ (2)

Solving equations 1 and 2;
Multiply (1) by 10 and subtract two from the result,
10x+10y = 2050
10x +15 y =2500
----------------------
        -5 y = --450 => y = 450/5 = $90
Then,
x= 205-90 = $115

Therefore,
Mechanic 1 charged $115 per hour
Mechanic 2 charged $90 per hour

Materialism

It is clear that what is most important to many characters in the novel is what money can buy them. The reader sees this not only with Gatsby, who throws his party so that Daisy one day will hopefully walk in and be impressed with his things, but with other characters too. The owl-eyed man in Gatsby's library is so impressed that the books are real! Tom buys a puppy for Myrtle and also feels a bit like he owns her. This obsession with 'things' was very prevalent in the 1920s all around.

The correct answer is negatively reinforced. 

Negative reinforcement refers to a learning process whereby a behavior or response is reinforced and much more likely to be repeated in the future if a negative outcome is avoided or removed as a result of performing the behavior. In this instance, Brian's avoidance of singing is being negatively reinforced because avoiding singing is removing his feelings of anxiety associated with singing and being in the spotlight.

The correct answer is the second option - B. Thomas Paine’s Common Sense was published in 1776, and the Revolutionary War began that same year.
A is incorrect because using BUT to connect these two sentences would mean that the second sentence is the opposite of the first one, which is not the case here. C is incorrect because using 'when' and 'that same year' in the same sentence is grammatically incorrect. D is incorrect because 'once' implies that the Revolutionary War started first, which is not the case.

The U. S House of Representatives voted to outlaw a specific type of biological experimental procedures. Proponents of the bill called certain experiments ghoulish, immoral and dangerous, but others argued that it was immoral to prevent research that might ultimately help people with incurable ailments like Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and spinal cord injuries. In fact, advances in this area are consistently made overseas, because opposition to such research is so strong in this country. In this example, research in the fields of DNA technology and mapping the human genome are being hindered in the United States. The answer is letter D.

Most robots have no interest in harming the human population at all; they existto aid people in making life safer, healthier, and more productive. Working together, humans and robots can get the job done. There are robots on Earth that exist specifically to boost human health. With the help of robots, scientists are working to create an exoskeleton that will attach itself to the outside of the human body, establishing a connection to the human brain.

Main Ideas:
I. Robots are not villians. They are here to help everyone.
II. Robots are great helpers in everything. They make human's work easier.
III. Robots also work out in space to ensure the safety of human life. (Don't add this, but think of how many humans have died out there in space... it's dangerous)
IV. Robots and machines can even recreate or support human health. (This can be found in the second to last sentence in that paragraph).
V. We shouldn't be so negative with robots because of the influence of movies. Robots are the next generation of help in future years to come.

1. Not exactly the first animated film, but is considered to be the first animated feature film was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" It was the first film created that was completely hand-drawn. His previous works were usually made using cutouts and stop motion. 

2. There were actually two big honchos of the film industry who were interested in Alexander Schure's Work. One of them was Francis Ford Coppola, director of , ""The Godfather."" The other one was George Lucas, the creator of, ""Star Wars."" So your answer would be D.

3. A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations and/or images. They are arranged in a sequence so that the animators can pre-visualize the sequence of events and actions and dialogues of each event. It serves as a blueprint for the whole film. 

4.  3-D printing has been hailed as the phenomenon that will bring forth the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Much like the previous revolution, 3-D printing will take global income levels to the next step. Rendering services more efficiently was one of the highlights of technology, with regards to digital media. However, 3-D printing will also be able to drive the supply-side of the economy.

5. 3-D printing is the process of making physical objects from a three dimensional model. The are made by joining materials and solidifying them through computer control. Layers of the material are laid out one by one in succession to create the object. So your answer is A.

6. The first video game console was made by Atari. Atari Pioneered the home video game console industry. One of its earliest products was a game called ""Pog,"" created by Allan Alcorn. Pong was the first commercially successful video game. The answer is C.

7. The kids of the 1980s basically played with two-dimensional sticks, dots, and quadrilateral-shaped characters is false. The 1980's was the kick off years of video gaming. Although still mostly in 2D, graphic designs were much more advanced and around 1987, 3D games were introduced. 
 

8. France and Japan produced some of the earliest examples of animation. French animation dates back to the early 19th Century. The first Japanese animation was said to have first come out around the 1910's. Verifiable films though were dated to at least 1917.

9. The CAD that we use today is different from the CAD that was used in the 1980's. The introduction of PC, tablets, and smartphones have greatly influenced the potentials and used of CAD. Mostly used in the engineering industry in the past, CAD is now used across many fields and other industries. So your answer is False.

11. Steven Spielberg is an Academy Award Winning director, producer, and screenwriter. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the film industry of all time. He has won 3 Academy awards and was nominated for 7 for the Best Director Category.

12. Pixar Animation Studios, is a computer animation film studio that produced 19 feature films. The very first computer animation film that was produced by Pixar was Toy Story in 1995. They also produced Monster's Inc in 2001, and Finding Nemo in 2003. 

13. 3-D modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence will allow for law-enforcement agents to recreate crime scenes. The Hong Kong Police already use this technique to better understand court cases. They also use it to plan raids and assess terrorist threats.  

14. It was Alexander Schure who founded the New Institute of Technology. He wished to be the next, ""Walt Disney,"" of film making. However, he did not have the same creative mind as Disney when it came to making story lines. So the answer to that question is false. 

15. Robotics is the branch of engineering that deals with the building of robots. They deal with the design, concept, manufacturing and operations of robots. So with that definition, you could say that  robotics team is a group or team that work together to build robots.

So basically you have a class, and within that class you have methods and instance variables; very much like how object oriented programming works in other languages. However, the main difference is that the class constructor in Python is defined right within the class object and is denoted by the method name, ""__init__"" and requires a parameter of ""self"". 
Ex:
class Py:
    def __init__(self):
          constructor code...
The __init__ method is what is called first when an object of the class is instantiated. The way you instantiate an object is by the following:
object_name = Py()

If you wanted to make your class more useful, you could add more parameters to your __init__ constructor, so when an object is created you can pass arguments to that object:
class Py:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
         self.name = name
         self.age = age
         print ""Your name is %s and you are %d years old"" % (name, age)
def main():
     Bob = Py(""Bob"", 23)
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
     main()

This code would give you: Your name is Bob and you are 23 years old

The answer is D. Blackbody radiation. The piece of iron glows red because its temperature is around 1000 K, then yellow because its temperature is around 2800 K, and then white because its temperature is around 5500K. This shows that the spectrum of the radiation is determined by absolute temperature, as when the temperature of a blackbody radiator increases, the peak of the radiation curve moves to shorter wavelengths.

In this chapter, Nick Carraway details the sort of people attending Gatsby's fortnightly lavish parties. As expected these extravagantly large events would be attended by the rich, famous, powerful, most opulent of all in the society. There is, somehow, a divide between ""old money"" and ""new money"" from different parts of America. Here the concept of American dream is at work. ""New money"" folks worked their way to achieve that American dream. The ""old money"" rich do not necessarily approve of them, but they swam in the same circles still. Even in the highest rank of the society, there is still hierarchy at work.

The vertices of the current cover are:
 R '(12, 0); S '(0, 0); T '(0, 16); U '(12, 16)
 The vertices of the design are:
 R (3, 0); S (0, 0); T (0, 4); U (3, 4)
 We then have the following relationship:
 ((1/4) x ', ((1/4) y') -----> (x, y)
 Equivalently:
 (1/4) R '= R
 (1/4) S '= S
 (1/4) T '= T
 (1/4) U '= U
 Therefore, the points are proportional and the proportionality constant is:
 k = 1/4
 Answer:
 Yes; the corresponding sides are proportional.","97","395","12","0","0","0","0","97.0","1","0","40.47164948453608","58","0","0"

From 1861-1863, the Confederate army was winning the Civil War. The South had better generals and defensive strategies while the North military leaders argued with their political
leaders.

from 1863-1865, the
weight of the Northern population and industrial capacity turned the war. South lost its best general, Jackson while the North army was led by Grant. The Emancipation
Proclamation freed all slaves in Confederate territories and Inspired Southern slaves to escape which forced
Southern whites to worry about their farms.

The Civil War ended by 1865 due to Grant's leadership and appointment of Sherman to lead the Southern campaign. The South lost the war subsequent to the loss at Gettsbury in 1863.

Following the encounters of applied anthropologists amid the war, the Society for Applied Anthropology embraced the primary morals explanation for American anthropologists. The 1948 code does not allude particularly to the war, however states that anthropologists must assume liability for the impacts of their proposals, and should endeavor to avoid chains of occasions that outcome in loss of wellbeing or on the other hand life.

Beginning about 1890, approximately twenty states enacted segregation laws directed primarily at African Americans.
- this is a true statement. 

This segregation also included Asians and Mexicans. 

how about this statement: 

Slavery was an established institution until the Twelfth Amendment was ratified on December 18, 1865.
???

It's false because it was the Thirteenth Amendment, not the Twelfth. The Twelfth Amendment was ratified in 1804 and it concerned the election of the President and Vice-President

"According to the indictment against him, Charles Schenck tried to send something through the mail illegally.

Charles Schenck was a Socialist Party leader in the US who opposed US participation in World War I.  He mailed pamphlets to men who'd been drafted that said the government had no right to send American citizens to war to kill people in other countries.  Schenck was convicted of violating the Espionage Act, which had been passed by Congress in 1917.

Schenck appealed his case to the Supreme Court, saying the Espionage Act was unconstitutional.   In the 1919 decision in Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction against Schenck.  Thus the Court essentially upheld the constitutionality of the Espionage Act at that time, saying that in wartime the government has extra responsibility to protect the safety of the nation.  The decision, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, said, ""The question in every case is whether the words are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.""

V=(4/3)pir^3

so

given
v=1331
1331=(4/3)pir^3
times both sides by 3/4
998.25=pir^3
divide both sides by pi
998.25/pi=r^3
cube root both sides
∛(998.25/pi)=r

ok
SA=4pir^2
SA=4pi(∛(998.25/pi))²
SA=4pi(∛(996503.0625/(pi²)))

(Depositing money into a bank reduces currency and increases demand deposit by equal amounts. If the bank keeps this entire deposit as part of its reserves, the $100 deposit has no effect on the money supply. However, if the bank lends a portion of the deposit-say $10-that portion now exists both as a demand deposit and as currency, thereby increasing the money supply.

I guess the problem is asking for the induced emf in the coil.

Faraday-Neumann-Lenz states that the induced emf in a coil is given by:

where
N is the number of turns in the coil
 is the variation of magnetic flux through the coil
 is the time interval

The coil is initially perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, so the initial flux through it is given by the product between the magnetic field strength and the area of the coil:

At the end of the time interval, the coil is parallel to the field, so the final flux is zero:


Therefore, we can calculate now the induced emf by using the first formula:

There were a lot of social, political and economic impacts of the Revolutionary War (aka the American Revolution), considering American culture. For example, democracy was introduced to America, leaving behind their monarchy. Another example is that women are now seen to have more of a say and rights to do other things that men would normally carry out, such as starting a career. A final example is that slavery is also taken more seriously nowadays due to this incredible war. Slavery was a horrific issue during the revolution, with hundreds that suffered fatally.

Burmese Pythons are an invasive species which means they are not native to the ecosystem they are currently in. This means that the pythons have no natural predators and can easily deplete food sources for other organisms in that ecosystem. Less food for other organisms results in rapid population loss of species that are native to that ecosystem.

>Someone releases Burmese Pythons in the Everglades.
>The Everglades have no predators to keep their population at bay.
>The Burmese Python population spirals out of control.
>The pythons begin eating all the rats and mice in the Everglades.
>Large birds, small reptiles, and other native snake species find less and less food.
>Native organism populations begin falling.

"Answer: 57

=====================================================

Explanation:

Convert each raw score to a z score
If x = 63.4, then
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (63.4-72.3)/8.9
z = -1

if x = 81.2, then 
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (81.2-72.3)/8.9
z = 1

So P(63.4 < x < 81.2) is the same as P(-1 < z < 1)

Through the empirical rule (aka the 68-95-99.7 rule), we know that roughly 68% of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean. In other words
P(-1 < z < 1) = 0.68 approximately (see note below)

Multiply 0.68 by the total 84 to get
0.68*84 = 57.12
which rounds to 57 people

Note: we can use a calculator to get a more accurate result of 0.68268949; a data table works as well but it won't be as accurate. For the purposes of this problem, the value 0.68 is good enough

Anatomical And Embryonic Evidence Of Evolution

Introduction to Evidence for Evolution

Comparing the anatomy of different species is one major type of evidence for evolution. The main areas of comparative anatomy are anatomical and embryonic evidence.

Anatomical- bone structure

Embryonic- development of unborn organisms


Anatomical Evidence

Anatomical evidence compares the bones structures of various species.
Types of structures:

Homologous- same structure, different function

Analogous - same function, different structure

Vestigial - no function, leftover from ancestor


Embryonic Evidence

Embryos are unborn, developing organisms that often look very different in adult form. Many different species have similar looking embryos, which means early traits are shared between many species. The conclusion is evolutionary relatedness.

B. Trivial vs crucial decisions.

The story mentions family and he did command a ship but a theme is a general, underlying thing that shapes the story itself. The navy guy wouldn't be feeling any of this if he hadn't seen suffering and violence and stress during his time at war. So it influences his behaviour with his family/friends at home. Therefore, the theme of the story is about the importance of life decisions. He no longer views these minute things (like vacation spots and home decor) as important.

"Zimbardo's simulation of prison life provided a dramatic demonstration of the power of ""roles"" on behavior. 


There are numerous ways that individuals can impact our behavior, yet maybe a standout amongst the most imperative is that the nearness of others appears to set up desires. One manner by which these desires wind up obvious is the point at which we take a gander at the parts that individuals play in the public eye. Social parts are the part individuals play as individuals from a social gathering. With every social part you receive, your conduct changes to fit the desires both you and others have of that part.

The House un-American Activities Committee founded to investigate communistic activity in American following WWI often targeted Hollywood actors/actresses and writers. As artists tend to be expressive and creative, their work was often pinpointed as non-American. As threats of being blacklisted grew, many artists conformed to American ideals and values as their way of protecting themselves. Consequently, pop culture was conformist and met the demands of government which wanted ""normalcy"". The goals of sitcoms was to demonstrate the proper American values of family, hard work, and patriotism. It is youth generations in the mid-to-late 1950s which will begin to challenge this conformity through beatnik writing and rock-n-roll music.

"Initially, the patriots
who fought lacked military training.  The
British were veterans of several wars both in the colonies and abroad.  They were disciplined and mastered battle
formations as well as being well-equipped. 
However, the many who joined the war were seasoned hunters and their
weapons were rifled muskets that fire farther and are more accurate.  When they failed at traditional means of
warfare, they fell back on their hunting skills and used that to fight the
British.  Later officers like Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben trained Washington’s
troops who became more disciplined and this helped them win the war.","101","545","1","0","0","4","0","16.833333333333332","6","0","10.956369636963693","10","0","0"

We can model both planets as a sphere.
 We have then:
 For the earth:
 v1 = (4/3) * (pi) * (r1 ^ 3)
 v1 = (4/3) * (pi) * ((3960) ^ 3)
 For Jupiter:
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * (r2 ^ 3)
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * ((44423) ^ 3)
 Dividing both equations we have:
 v2 / v1 = ((44423) ^ 3) / ((3960) ^ 3)
 v2 / v1 = 1411.685958
 Rounding off we have:
 v2 = 1412v1

 the volume of Jupiter is 1412 times larger than the volume of the Earth

Yes, that is true. Yellow and green colors are now the major colors of these fire engines due to our eye-sights. In the dark, red is one of the least visible colors so imagine what would happen if it was at night and you could barely see it. On the other hand, colors like yellow and green are spotted more easily and raise awareness in a proper and eye-catching way.

The Panama Canal connected the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. It established a new international trade route and boosted the U.S. economy with its ability to trade more. Because of the canal, the ships did not have to sail around Cape Horn in South America. The travel distance was cut by almost half so the ships saved a lot on fuel. Carrying less fuel means they could carry more goods. 
The United States Navy could travel easily from the Pacific to the Atlantic. It allowed the U.S. Navy to maintain a smaller Navy on both sides and gave the U.S. a tactical advantage with their ability to cross to the other side quickly. Other countries had to travel around Cape Horn.

Warning: The following statements are partial speculation. Make of them what you will and hopefully they will help you generate an adequate answer. 

-Individuals with clinical depression are less likely to go out, as they feel less inclined to socialize and are likely to lose the drive to leave their homes and perform daily tasks. Your body needs exercise and neglecting to use it can't be good.

-People who are depressed are more likely to develope eating disorders such as anorexia and binge eating. Both place strain on the heart and body in multiple ways. 

- If you understand how a Placebo works, you know that how how a person feels physically can be linked to mentality. If an individual thinks they are being given a life saving medicine when they are only receiving a sugar tablet, their health may still inprove slightly. By this logic, we can assume an individual with a declining mental health has a chance to show a decline in physical health.

It is a fancier/more proper replacement for the variable 'y'. The same is used for the letter g as in g(x) and h as in h(x).

I believe the correct answer is B.Great loss must be endured before great things can happen; Aunt Gold Teeth knows this is a test and responds by throwing away her Christian items.

Gold Teeth is an Indian woman who is torn between Hinduism and Christianity; her need to pray was very strong, although it was enough to save her husband from death. She does also blame herself for his death and for the fact that she does not have children, but as her Grandmother said, perhaps this tragic event is what was needed to bring her back to her faith for the Hindu Gods.

Maybe the greatest contrast amongst people, and between gatherings of ladies, concerns what Dr. Levinson called ''The Dream.'' Between ages 22 and 28, a young fellow designs a speculative life structure. He shapes a fantasy: his vision of himself on the planet, his objectives and desires. The dreams are for the most part identified with occupation, said Dr. Levinson. He'll be a boxer, a supervisor or a football star - the legend of his own story. Ladies have more prominent trouble shaping the dream, he said.

important in the process of etymology.  Language,
just like our physical bodies, evolves through time and they may sometimes
depend on the historical events that occur within specific areas. People adapt
to these events and coin words based on their experiences.  ","79","413","0","0","0","1","0","13.166666666666666","6","0","8.285991561181437","9","0","0"

I'll assume the second case. Split the interval into 4 smaller ones, taking

Skipping the second one since I already answered it.

For the third, split up the region of integration at some arbitrary constant  between  and , then differentiate and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.










Since , it follows that  is constant.

Not to long ago professional e-cigarettes came out, and having been advertising substances for a long time, even though there is not a lot of research on, the e-cig company's are still pushing advertising.

Fashion is a strong force that has always played a significant role in the evolution of mankind’s society. As far back as the Egyptian, Greek and Roman Empires, fashion was a key social element that reflected the society through apparel, accessories and cosmetics. Fashion also had an influence on decisions regarding politics, economy, education and art. In the ancient Roman Empire, the visual representation of fashion was so ingrained within the society that the ruling government decreed the models and colours of shoes worn by the members of each social class. Also during the early years of industrialization, wealthy Americans and Asians travelled to Europe to acquire luxury goods, boosting international trade and the expansion of the global economy. In addition, the Grand Nobles of the Renaissance period and the aristocrats of the past centuries all stamped their significance and contribution to society’s evolution through fashion. The fashion tradition remains prevalent today, albeit in a modern way.","159","874","2","0","0","0","0","22.714285714285715","7","0","14.869407008086256","17","0","0"

Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his New Deal, made one of the most popular social programs to help the elderly. This is called the Social Security Administration. 

The Social Security Administration still exists today. This program provides direct financial assistance (aka money) to elderly American citizens. All American citizens pay into this system through taxes and are able to receive money from this agency once they reach a certain age. This program also results in the development of each citizen having a social security number, which is an important piece of information that allows the government to keep records of American citizens.

The correct answer is 1 second.
A period is a physical term which describes the time needed for one cycle of vibration to complete and reach a certain point. In this example, the term period refers to the time needed for one complete heartbeat to occur. Since 60 heartbeats occur in 60 seconds, then one heartbeat needs 1 second to complete.

Molality is defined as the number of moles of solute in 1 kg of solvent.
molality of solution to be prepared is 0.50 molal
this means that in 1000 g of water there should be 0.50 mol of NaCl
if 1000 g of water should contain - 0.50 mol 
then 750.0 g of water requires - 0.50 mol/kg x 0.750 kg = 0.375 mol
mass of NaCl in 0.375 mol - 58.5 g/mol x 0.375 mol = 21.9 g
therefore a mass of 21.9 g of NaCl is required

 Lets start with the color white as the first layer.
2) Solve the cross.
Find the side with the white square in the center and put it on top. Set into position the four edge pieces that contain white. (You should be able to do this by yourself without needing algorithms.) All four edge pieces can be placed in a maximum of eight moves (five or six in general). Place the cross at the bottom. Turn the cube over 180° so that the cross is now on the bottom.

3) Solve the four corners of the first layer, one by one. 
At the end of this step, the first layer should be complete, with a solid color (in this case, white) at the bottom.

The branch of government that would most likely act in the event of a sudden stock market crash is the legislative branch. The legislative branch consists of the Senate and House of Representatives (which is the US Congress). The legislative branch is the branch responsible for: 

-create and vote on laws in the US
-it can declare war
-it can investigate power
-it can confirm Presidential appointments
-it can approve treaties
-it can create spending bills
-it can impeach government officials 

The executive branch (president, vice president, presidential cabinet) enforces the law. The judicial branch (supreme and federal courts) interprets the law. State is only at state level and not at the federal level.

The contrast between the regular chapters and the intercalary chapters serves as an illustration of the part to whole relationship between the Joad family and the American farmer.

"The inner membrane is responsible for cellular respiration and thus, contains proteins involved in electron transport and ATP synthesis. This membrane envelops the mitochondrial matrix, where the electrons are produced (the citric acid cycle) and then travel from one protein complex to the next in the inner membrane (electron transport chain). The final electron acceptor is O2, and this ultimately forms H2O. At the same time, the electron transport chain produces ATP (oxidative phosphorylation via ATP synthase). ATP synthase uses concentration gradient of H+ (formed during electron transport), power synthesis of the energy molecule-ATP.

According to Chicago School of Sociology, urban environment is created by a lot of groups of people which come in together from various backgrounds.

To my opinion, the key to happiness is inside all of us.
First of all, happiness comes from inside, and even if it could depend on exterior factors, we will not be happy unless we know where to find it. Most of us think that if we buy what we wish the most, or if we are rich, we are happy. But it is just a misconception. Happiness does not depend on objects, but on feelings.
Secondly, happiness is just like a locked door. To find the key to it, we find the door first, and to do that, we just need to know ourselves better. To help people, and by seeing their smiles, we will feel a warmth inside. That is happiness. 
There is not just one key - people are all different, and each of them has a different key, a different purpose, and a different door to open.
Happiness is a choice. And when we realise this, we are very close to find its key too.
To sum up, I would say that all we have to do in order to find the key to happiness is to open our eyes properly, and to see what the majority cannot see.

1. A transgenic organism expresses DNA that has been derived from another species. These organisms have altered genomes and are generated in the laboratory for the purposes of research, for example, the ""knock-out"" mice are tansgenic mice with a particular gene of interest disabled. 
2. Recombinant DNA is the DNA that has been altered to contain genes, or portions of genes, from different organisms. The DNA molecules are formed in the lab using recombination methods to bring together genetic material from multiple sources and therefore creating sequences that are not found in the genome. 
3. Restriction enzymes are found naturally in bacteria and they cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. These enzymes are also called restriction endonucleases, they cleave DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites called restriction sites. They are found in bacteria and archaea and they serve to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses.
4. Biotechnology is the use or alteration of organisms, cells, or biological molecules to produce food, drugs, or other goods. Living systems and organisms are used to make or develop products. Biotechnology enhances cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and product for the purposes of improving life and health. 
5. Polymerase chain reaction is a technique that is used to quickly synthesize billions of copiies of a specific segment of DNA.  It is a quick and a very efficient way to generate many copies of DNA.  The process is applicable when there are small quantities of DNA to analyze. The events of PCR involves; separation of DNA strands, addition of primers, use of DNA polymerase to produce second strand of DNA. 
6. In the process known as transformation, bacteria take up pieces of DNA from the surroundings. Bacterial transformation results from the uptake of naked DNA (DNA without associated cells or proteins). Transformation may also occur naturally in some species of bacteria.

A linocut is a type of relief print. Relief printing is when a piece of paper is “stamped” with ink from the top surface of the plate.
Other types of relief prints are woodcuts and engraving. Essentially, a linocut is the same as a woodcut but the plate isn’t wood, it’s a piece of linoleum, and because of the softness of the plate, it is easier to carve.
When you carve your lino you are cutting away the area that will be white and leaving the area that will be black (or coloured if you are printing in colour). Linocuts were originally made popular by Picasso, while before that they were simply regarded as a student’s medium to practise for woodcuts.

Why is it already answered within the question? not that im complaining.... is it so that we can have free points or somethin??? in that case....... Making a Linocut basically your taking your design and using the negative space to paint the same picture over and over. It is a very easy and effective method to use.How ever it´s main drawback is unless you make a bunch of different ones you are stuck with one design.

Okay so always start by knocking out the answers that you know are incorrect! This helps a lot. So we know B isn't the answer because the destruction was widespread. And we know it wasn't D because the population changed a lot, by 250,000+ people. So that leaves us with A and C as possible answers. C is most unlikely the answer because to this day, the jobs are still very low and because of this, the money was very low. So I would think the answer is A. Good luck! :)

However, even in this social stratum, there is still a divide -- old money and new money. The old money people have had their wealth passed on from generation to generation, supposedly from rich European ancestors. New money folks worked hard to gain their wealth and did not come from rich families. In this regard, the proud old money look down on the new money since they do not really see them as part of the wealthiest.

After the Civil War, liberty was defined as the rights of all men to be treated equally under the law. The US government did their best to ensure that this happened, by implementing the 14th and 15th amendment. These amendments granted citizenship to any person born on US soil, guaranteed equal legal treatment under the Equal protection clause, and allowed black men the right to vote. These were all supposed to be positive steps towards creating a society in which ""liberty"" meant that all men had the same legal and political rights. 

However, this ideal world did not exist after the Civil War. The implementation of Jim Crow laws and ""separate but equal"" facilities created a society in the South which was based on unequal treatment of African-American citizens.

Answer: A. the field of radioactivity

Marie Curie was perhaps the most female scientist that ever lived. She made a huge leap in the science world. She discovered radium and polonium, and not just that, she inspired other young women that they can make a difference in the world. Back then, women could only be wives and mothers and teachers or tutors. They were not supposed to be scientists or professors. But, she did not let those ideas stop her. She made up her mind that she would be a scientist. She devoted her life to the study of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first person ever to win it twice. Her work on radioactivity helped scientists understand the world better. It helped doctors cure cancer. And it helped to change the way people thought about women. But Marie did not set out to change the world. She simply followed her dream --- to be the best scientist she could be.

In the 1960's when the separation of the church and state became a legal law. This affected religion in schools which in return affected the youth that was growing up during such times. Even though public schooling was meant for an all around education religion was once able to influence the body ( including students and teachers). But in the 70's religion became viewed as something that didn't deal with education and was instead something children should learn at home from parents or the church. This affected politics because politics and the governmental laws go hand in hand.

The correct answer is B.

Let us think of the classical theory first. In the classical theory, light is a wave that gives energy. This energy gradually helps the electron jump to a higher energy level.
In quantum theory, this is wrong; an electron cannot absorb a small amout of energy because there is not close enough state to jump to with that energy; only very specific amounts of energy lead to a change in orbital levels/ absorbance of energy. Also, each pair of energy levels has a specific energy difference that is needed from an electron so that it can move. 
Hence, B is correct; all other sentences describe classical models of light-electron interactions

The answer is 57.04 meters. 
Solution:
The height y of the rock above the ground as a function of the horizontal distance x from the starting point on top of the hill can be modeled by the equation 
     y = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

We now set this equation equal to zero because the height of the ground where the rock will land is zero:
     0 = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

Since we have a quadratic equation, we can calculate for the horizontal distance x by using the quadratic formula     
     x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a      
     x = {-1.3 ± sqrt[1.3^2 - 4(-0.04)(56)]} / 2(-0.04)     
     x = (-1.3 ± sqrt(10.65)) / (-0.08)     
     x =  -24.54 meters or  57.04 meters
There are two solutions for x but one is negative, so we choose the positive value.

I'm struggling with the wording of the second choice. My background is physics and most of the people I know are dumbfounded by the vastness of space, the laws that govern physics, and the beauty and simplicity of the way the universe explains itself. I have met people who do not agree with my assessment of the Universe, but they are in the minority and they are not fools for declining to agree. 

I am trying to say that Religion and Science can coexist and many people feel this coexistence to be true without question. People pray for example who also manipulate complex mathematical ideas. We don't choose conflict without reason, but coexistence is always possible. It only takes men and women of good will to make it work.

If you confront someone right off the bat since you think they are talking to someone who talks about you behind your back or they are dating your boyfriend or your boyfriend is dating someone else behind your back don't confront. Trick them into telling you what they are doing or follow them and catch them in the act so they have no chance in saying that they didn't do it. Confrontation can lead to them lying to you. Sometimes you might be wrong and when you confront them and find out that it really wasn't what they were doing, they get mad and decide that they are going to leave you or are not going to talk to you. Or maybe they decide that they are going to forget about it and then confront you with something and let you feel the hurt and pain that that brings to a person. It will lead to them wanting to have revenge on you or they will want to do those things on purpose and flaunt it in your face.

When Galileo got ahold of a little telescope ... no more than 
a kid's toy today ... he soon turned it towards the night sky.  
The story says that he was the first one to do that.  Apparently 
everyone else who had these things used them to look at their 
neighbors' windows.  Anyway, When Galileo looked at Jupiter, 
he saw four tiny dots.  As he watched them night after night, he 
saw that the four dots always stayed with Jupiter, but got nearer 
and farther from it.  He eventually realized that they were small 
bodies in orbit around Jupiter.  And then ... because he was Galileo ... 
he made the big intellectual jump:  He reasoned that if there were 
smaller bodies in orbit around Jupiter, then Jupiter and the other 
planets might also be in orbit around something, and not necessarily 
around the Earth.  He understood this as evidence that the sun is 
the center of the solar system.

Your set is 2, 5 and 8.

In order to calculate the standard deviation, first, you need to calculate the mean of the scores:
m = (2 + 5 + 8) / 3
    = 15 / 3
    = 5

Then, find the variance: subtract the mean from each value, square the results, sum them up and divide it by the number of scores.
(2 - 5)² = 9
(5 - 5)² = 0
(8 - 5)² = 9
Therefore:
v = (9 + 0 + 9) / 3 
   = 18 / 3
   = 6

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
σ = √6 
   = 2.45

In conclusion, the standard deviation can be calculated by the formula:

The Renaissance scholars were much interested in reviving the classical era of Greek and Roman culture.   These areas of culture were revived in the visual arts and in architecture.  The humanists of the Renaissance studied Greek and Roman writings, focused on the ""humanities"" such as philosophy and history.  (Today we also call such studies the ""liberal arts."")

The Renaissance happened across Europe, but was sparked by affluent city-states in Italy.  These city-states were wealthy from products they made and some became very rich through trade and commerce.  Wealthy persons in the Italian cities were sponsors of art and architecture and liberal studies, thus promoting the culture of the Renaissance.  Much of this wealth came from trading with the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire, so there was an indirect role of Muslims in the support of the Renaissance.  The Medici family were granted permission from the pope for exclusive rights to alum trade with the Ottomans, thus enriching and empowering the Medici.    When the Ottomans took over sections of the old Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantine scholars fled to Italy, which also spurred the Renaissance movement in Italy.  Another way Muslims were in the background of Renaissance thought was how Muslim scholarship in math and science filtered over into European scholarship.

John Green, in Crash Course, argues against the ""Renaissance"" as a thing because the art and learning was only experienced at the top of society.  The vast majority of Europeans still lived on farms and were not well educated.  Most Europeans didn't encounter the Renaissance's pattern of thought during that time.  We remember it because of the ideas that came from it that are important to us now.  The Renaissance is more of a construct we have made out of various things that happened over a span of centuries.

As to whether or not you agree with Green's argument, that's up to you.

In order to find the answer to this question, you need to multiply 450 by 2 to find the amount of miles in the round trip, which is 900. 

Next, you divide 900 by 25, because that will leave you with the amount of gas it needs. 

So the answer is 36.

The correct answer is C. they both sought equal rights for African Americans. 

The 14th amendment states that any person born on US soil is automatically a US citizen. This was passed only a few years after the Civil War, as a means to ensure that newly freed slaves had all the freedoms/rights that white citizens had in society. 

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a federal law that bans work place discrimination. This means that a person cannot be stopped from obtaining a job based on their race, color, religion, gender, nation of origin, etc.

Evolution theory: This is purely based off the fact that we evolved to be bipedal; we walk on two legs, to see higher (a paramount evolutionary trait at the time). Had we just stuck to four, we would be faster. Greater stability is gifted to four-legged organisms. An advantage we DO have, however, is that we have the BEST running endurance in the animal kingdom.

Christianity: Adam and Eve were bipedal, so that's how we are.

Physiologically we're inadequately suited to sprinting, for the most part since we're bipedal. Creatures that can keep running on four legs are continually going to have the point of interest. There are two clarifications for this. The more ordinary one is basically that at no time in our development was running a critical adjustment for us. We went from tree-staying foragers to apparatus utilizing etc.

People aren't as quick in a sprint as some different creatures, yet we are among the best long-distance runners of all. It's a transformative exchange off; no one's body shape can be great at everything. Hunters like us additionally need to make a considerable measure of progress to chase and scavenge, so it bodes well that we are more suited to continuance running than sprinting.

The correct answer is high, low.

Arteries are part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying blood away from the heart and around the body. The arterial blood is oxygenated and this process ensures that every tissue around the body will receive oxygen and nutrients through this blood flow. 

Veins are also part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying the deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart. 

Venous pressure is much lower than the arterial pressure. More specifically, venous pressure ranges from 5 to 8 mmHg, while arterial pressure ranges from 15 to 30 mmHg.

Given that only the top 1% are admitted, the cutoff will be as follows:
the z-score is given  by:
z=(x-μ)/σ
where:
μ-mean
σ-standard deviation
P(x>X)=1-P(z<Z)=0.01
⇒P(z<Z)=1-0.01=0.99
thus:
the value of z that corresponds to 0.99 is 2.33
thus:
2.33=(x-600)/60
solving for x we get:
139.8=x-600
x=739.8
thus the cutoff was 739.8

The parts of the heart are the atria, ventricles, septum, valves. The atria collects oxygenated blood that has returned from the lungs.The ventricles , receive blood from the atria. The septum it separates the left atrium and ventricle from the right atrium and ventricle. Finally, the valves separate the various parts of the heart from one another. They allow blood into places it’s supposed to be and keep it out of places it’s not supposed to be.
Undoubtedly, there are more parts of the heart but these are the main functions.

some disadvantages: the side effects go GMOs are unknown so many people do not want to consume produce that has been genetically engineered.

Answer #1 is ""there is 2.5 grams of solute in every 100 g of solution."" 
We calculate for 2.5% by mass solution by dividing the mass of the solute by the mass of the solution and then multiply by 100.
Answer #2 is ""that mass ratio would be 2.5/100 or 2.5 grams of solute/100 grams of solution."" 
We weigh out 2.5 grams of solute and then add 97.5 grams of solvent to make a total of 100 gram solution, that is,
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g solute / (2.5g solute + 97.5g solvent)
                                                          = 2.5g solute / 100g solution
Answer#3 is ""a solution mass of 1 kg is 10 times greater than 100 g, thus one kilogram (1 kg) of a 2.5% ki solution would contain 25 grams of ki.""
We multiply 10 to each mass so that 100 grams becomes 1000grams since 1000 grams is equal to 1 kg:
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g*10/[(2.5g*10) + (97.5g*10)]
                                                          = 25g solute/(25g solute + 975g solvent)
                                                          = 25g solute/1000g solution

11.Allergic rhinitis is also known as hay fever. It is an inflammation in the nose which happens when the immune system overreacts to the allergens found in the air. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes and sometimes swelling. 

The answer is B.

12. Urticaria is also known as hives. It is a type of skin rash that is usually raised, red, itchy and bumpy. It is also known as weals, welts, or nettle rash. It can range from the size of just a few millimeters to the size of a hand. 

The answer is C.

13. Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. The condition that is more common in children but it can still occur at any age. You can have eczema along with asthma or hay fever. It turns the skin red and itchy. 

The answer is D.

14. Hives are often triggered by infection, certain foods or medications. They are also triggered by insect stings and bites. Sometimes even environmental conditions can trigger them like heat, cold, pressure and sun exposure. 

The answer is True.

15. Sinusitis is the acute or chronic inflammation of the cavities around the nasal passages or what you call sinuses. Inflammation can persist up to 12 weeks even when being treated. The inflammation interferes with drainage so the mucus builds up in the passages. 

16.  Allergy shots or vaccinations are more professionally known as immunotherapy. These shots help  the body get used to the allergens or the things that trigger an allergic reaction. They are not a cure, but they help your system to adjust to the allergen. 

The answer is D.

17. Mold and mildew are examples of fungi. They are related to plants but more closely related to animals. Other fungi include mushrooms, yeasts, smuts, and rusts. 

The answer is A.

18. ""Seeds"" of molds are called spores. They also form some plants, algae, fungi and protozoans. It is a unit of reproduction and may be sexual or asexual. Most fungal spores are made for airborne dispersal. 

19. Exposure to mold puts a person at greater risk of developing allergies. Any exposure to allergens can trigger allergic reactions. Another risk factor is history of asthma, family history of allergies or asthma and even age.

The answer is True. 

20. Fungi can grow in the human body. Examples of which are yeast infections. Yeast infections can grow on skin which cause a red itchy rash. Fungal infections are often caused bu fungi that are already available or common in the environment. 

The answer is False.

The answer is Process 1 describes artificial selection and process 2 describes genetic engineering. Artifical selection involves the artificial breeding of two or more species and selecting the desired traits. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genetic material  of an organism of a species to achieve desired  characteristics.
 
Question 17;
The answer is Both characteristics represent meiosis. This is a type of cell cycle that occurs in the gonads of organisms in the process of formation of gametes. The gametes cells have half the genetic material as the pre-gamete cells/or   somatic cells. For example, humans cells, that are usually diploid, are halved in meiosis to make gamete cell haploid.   Meiosis I halve the genetic material while meiosis II is similar to mitosis that duplicates.
 
Question 18;
  R R r Rr Rr r Rr RrThe answer is 4 red : 0 white
This is because the question asks for phenotypic ratio which is the morphology.  As shown in the punnet square, all the offspring will be heterozygous for the color, but since Red is dominant over white, all the offspring will exhibit the red color.
 
Question 19;
The answer is Heat water and records its change in temperature with time. This relates to the first law of thermodynamics, which stipulates on the law of conservation of energy.  Therefore when energy is put into a system, the system is expected to do work (in this case is the increase in temperatures).
 
Question 1;
The answer is The pea plant received different alleles from both parents. During the fusion of gametes from male and female, the haploid cells of the gametes fuse to form a haploid zygote. This zygote has alleles from both parents on virtually all genes. The dominant allele shows in the phenotype.
Question 2;
The answer is 25%This is because cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic disorder will only show in the offspring if they are recessive for both alleles in the gene for cystic fibrosis. The offspring that are heterozygous for the disease will show no symptoms because the dominant alleles mask the effect of the recessive allele.
 
Question 3;
  Y y y Yy Yy y Yy yy 
 
According to the statement, Yellow color is dominant over the green, because in the heterozygous plant, the yellow color masks the green color. Therefore, based on the punnet square above, 50% of the offspring will be yellow (heterozygous) and the other 50% will be green (homozygous recessive).
 
 
Question 4;
Damage to marine flora and fauna due to oil spills could be prevented. In case of an oil spill, the genetically-engineered pseudomonas bacteria will be able to break down the oil particles and convert them to biomolecules. This will remove the oil before it does more harm to an ecosystem.
 
Question 5;
They have Furry feet. This is one of the adaptations of the polar bears have to ensure that they survive the harsh cold climate of the Arctic region. They also have wide feet to reduce the pressure on their weight on the ice and therefore good for movement on the ice, especially thin ice

Gabriela owns a company that makes silk scarves. She buys the silk from an overseas supplier and is subject to a tax on imported goods. Gabriela most likely lives in a mixed market economy with some government regulation.

A mixed economic system features characteristics of both capitalism and socialism. A mixed economic system protects private property and allows a level of economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims. According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets, but proponents of government interventions argue that the base conditions such as equal information and rational market participants cannot be achieved in practical application.

Part (a): Annual worthy analysis
Annual worthy = -Annuities  of PV (cost) - Annual expenses + Annuities of FV (salvage cost)

Then,
For GM model:
Annual worthy = -36,000(A|P,12%,3) -4000 + 15,000(A|F,12%,3)
Where,
(A|P,12%,3) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12}^-1 = 0.41635;
(A|F,12%,3) = {[(1+0.12)^3-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.29635
Therefore,
Annual worthy for GM model = -36,000(0.41635) - 4,000 + 15,000(0.29635) = -$50,543.35

For Ford model:
Annual worthy = -32,000(A|P,12%,4) - 4,100 + 15,000(A|F,12%,4)
Where,
(A|P,12%,4) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12}^-1 = 0.32923
(A|F,12%,2) = {[(1+0.12)^4-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.20923
Therefore,
Annual worthy of Ford model = -32,000(0.32923) - 4,100 + 15,000 (0.20923) = -$11,496.91

It can be noted that Annual worth of Ford > Annual worthy of GM model and thus the best option is the Ford model

Part (b): Present Worth (PW)
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(P/A,12%,3) + 15,000(P/F,12%,3)
Where
(P/A,12%,3) = [1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12 = 2.40183
(P/F,12%,3) = 1/(1+0.12)^3 = 0.71178
Therefore,
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(2.40183) + 15,000 (0.71178) = -$34,930.62

PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(P/A,12%,4) + 15,000(P/F,12%,4)
Where,
(P/A,12%,4) = [1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12 = 3.03735
(P/F,12%,4) = 1/(1+0.12)^4 = 0.63552
Therefore,
PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(3.03735) + 15,000 (0.63552) = -$10,014.065

Based on PW, PW of Ford model > PW for GM model and thus Ford model is the better option.

X= # hours first mechanic worked
y= # hours second mechanic worked

QUANTITY EQUATION 
x + y= 20 hours 

COST EQUATION 
$115x + $80y= $1775


STEP 1:
multiply both sides of cost equation by -115

-115(x + y)= -115(20)
-115x - 115y= -2300


STEP 2:
add quantity equation and equation from step 1 together to solve for y

115x + 80y= 1775
-115x - 115y= -2300
x will cancel out

-35y= -525
divide both sides by -35
y= 15 hours second mechanic worked


STEP 3:
substitute y value in quantity equation to solve for x

x + y= 20
x + 15= 20
subtract 15 from both sides
x= 5 hours first mechanic worked


ANSWER: The first mechanic worked 5 hours and the second mechanic worked 15 hours. 

Hope this helps! :)

Although the answer to this question remains uncertain, one theory is that an ancient land bridge may have allowed fauna from what is now China to reach Java. The theory is that the present-day Philippine Islands once formed part of a land bridge between mainland China and present day Java. This allowed vertebrates from the Chinese mainland to colonise Java. Supposedly, this occurred around the Pleistocene.
