"When you mean ""Father"", do you actually mean the F•_Î_rher (Hitler)? The thing that is important to understand here is: Hitler was considered, before we knew all he had done, a charismatic and well, loving. Thing is, his kindness was only towards the Jews (and others, like homosexuals, disabled etc.) and those who were against his regime. The people of Germany wouldn't have voted for him or supported him if there wasn't a propaganda about the great qualities he had. Also, in his head, and a lot of his fellow nazi followers, Jews were not people but a pest to exterminate. Another final thing to understand is: nothing is perfectly black or white. Hitler looked in fact quite civil when you meet him (apparently) and kind and patient as he was also a vegetarian and loved dogs, however he still had this poisonous and hurtful mentality that led millions in the embrace of death.."
"Generally, there were two major factors that led to its decline: one was the class conflict caused by the heavy taxation, the other one was the ethnic contradiction resulting from the 'Four Class System'.The Yuan court actually first began to decline during the reign of Emperor Renzong, when peasant uprisings emerged in southern China. However, despite the warning of the uprisings, corruption of the Yuan court officials continued. Also, power struggles within the ruling class became more and more serious. For instance in the short period from the beginning of Emperor Wuzong's reign in 1308 to the start of Emperor Huizong's reign in 1333, there were eight emperors. During this period, the corruption became severe as subordinate officials were commonly appointed on the basis of bribery rather than merit; the land was gradually concentrated in the hands of Mongolian aristocrats and a select group of powerful Han landlords; a fiscal crisis in the Yuan court also broke out due to the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling class. Even worse, the Mongolian army became corrupt and gradually disintegrated.During the reign of the last emperor, the real power of the Yuan regime fell into the hands of Cheng Xiang (prime minister) named Bo Yan, who was born of a Mongolian noble family. He was rather hostile to the Han people and introduced a series of policies unfavorable to the Han. This magnified the seriousness of the ethic contradiction. Misfortunes never come singly. The Yellow River burst its banks three times in the late Yuan Dynasty. As a result, serious natural disasters broke out and the masses were forced to live in dire poverty. Under such circumstances, groups of farmers left the land and successively launched armed uprisings. Although many peasants' uprisings were successfully suppressed by the Yuan army, the corrupt regime of the Yuan Dynasty was constantly impacted by this surging wave and teetered on the verge of collapse.https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/yuan/decline.htmhope this looooong answer helped."

"In ChildrenA baby's bones begin to grow in the womb. At birth, the skeleton is partially formed. Many bones are still in ""parts."" The ends (epiphyses) and bony shafts (diaphyses) of long bones form separately in the womb. At birth, the ends of the long bones are mainly cartilage, with centers of bone beginning to form inside. As a child grows, the shafts get longer, and bone gradually replaces the cartilage epiphyses. Through the growing years, a layer of cartilage (the growth plate) separates each epiphyses from the bone shaft.•__Clavicle.•__•__Image courtesy of: Smithsonian InstitutionBetween 17 and 25 years, normal growth stops. The development and union of separate bone parts is complete. At this point, you and your skeleton are as tall as you are going to get - with many fewer bone parts than you started with!Facts:The clavicle (collar bone), pictured above, is the last bone to complete growth, at about age 25.Measuring the length of long bones can give an estimate of age for children, but this technique is useful only until bones have stopped growing.The tibia completes growth at about age 16 or 17 in girls, and 18 or 19 in boys.For toddlers to teenagers up to age 21, teeth are the most accurate age indicators.•__Learn more here!In AdultsSkeletons record an adult's age in several ways.

"Weight loss and dynamics of plant nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, Zn and Cu) in leaf litter were studied in a mature beech forest in South Sweden, using the litter bag technique. An initial decomposition period of about 12 to 18 months was characterized by an absolute net increase of N, P, and S contents in litter, followed by a period of net release of these elements. This development, which was most obvious for N and P, was interpreted as a change from a phase where decomposer activity was limited by the availability of nutrient elements to an energy-limited phase. A net release of nitrogen did not occur until after two years of decomposition, and a transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus between different litter layers is here proposed to work as a retention mechanism.Potassium and sodium were quickly leached from the litter, while release of magnesium, calcium, and initially also manganese, was more associated to organic matter weight loss. Iron, zinc and copper were all strongly accumulated in the litter material. This is explained by mineral soil admixture for the former element and by atmospheric fall-out in combination with the chemical complex formation character for the latter two elements.Finally, the importance of the different release processes in the total nutrient recycling of the forest is discussed.."

Should the United States government legislate desegregation? Is racial mixing desirable and/or necessary in our educational system? As a teacher I feel that these issues must be brought into the classroom in such a way that students can understand the different positions and can figure out their opinions. For adolescents, learning to work wi th and relate to people of all different backgrounds are important skills.This unit has been organized for students with a high school reading level. Since 1982, when I prepared it, it has been used as a segment of a course at the High School in the Community, an inner city magnet high school which is teacher run and very suppo rtive to teacher initiated curriculum. I first used the unit as the history half of an interdisciplinary course in English and history. The English component focused on forming opinions and writing essays. The class meet daily for three hours. I have sinc e used this unit in conjunction with other subjects such as statistics and poll making, drama in the courtroom, and philosophy as reflected in various legal systems throughout history. Since this course has proven to be very stimulating for the students, I have also expanded it into a larger course on the American Legal System.Although I have planned this course for a particular context, I feel that both the material content and the format can be applied in many other school settings. This course has stimulated student interest in history, current events and the power of the American legal system. Using primary sources such as legal documents, newspaper and magazine articles, and autobiographical essays, students are exposed to many different points of view. They learn that history is alive and powerful in their world. The legal system works with decisions made in the past, applies them to the present and then reshapes the future. The students in these classes have found that they really enjoyed studying and debating the legal issues that I have raised as they pertain to many different aspects of American life today.."

"The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The largest tigers have reached a total body length of up to 3.38m (11.1ft) over curves and have weighed up to 388.7kg (857lb) in the wild. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by IUCN. The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, of which about 2,000 exist on the Indian subcontinent.[4] A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals.[5][6]Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than 1,184,911km2(457,497sqmi), a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s.."

"The alternation of generations in the life cycle of a plant includes the diploid and haploid multicellular stages. diploid and haploid are copies of the chromosomes. The spores in the plant is unicellular and when they start dividing through mitosis, it produces identical cells. These identical cells are all haploid. Haploid stages contain one set of chromosome from either of the parent. These identical cells create a multicellular system called the gametophytes. A gametophyte is the haploid multicellular stage in the life cycle of a plant. The gametophyte makes the gametes. These gametes are responsible for sexual fertilization. It takes place when a sperm (male gametes) from the male fuses into the egg cell (female gametes) of the female. The formation of both male and female gametes creates a diploid zygote. Diploid stages contain one set of chromosome from each parent. This is where the sporophyte comes in. A sporophyte is the diploid multicellular stage in the life cycle of the plant. It now contains the two sets of chromosomes from each parent. The type of cell division that produces gametes with half the normal chromosome number is the meiosis. Meiosis is the type of cell division used in sexual reproduction. It will occur in the testes and ovaries..."
"Maxwell's equations expanded upon known relations of electric and magnetic fields through determining that various forms of light are sources of electromagnetic energy that may be produced through transmitting magnetic currents through conducive materials. Electromagnetic energies vary depending upon their wavelengths, which visibly manifest themselves in a spectrum of colors that occur in natural phenomena, such as the Northern Lights.Magnetic energy may be generated to attract other metal pieces or to store power in the form of batteries and dams. The hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls generates electricity through rotating magnetic field forces discovered by Nikola Tesla, who developed polyphase alternating current generators capable of changing the direction of voltage.Electromagnetism is additionally harnessed in the form of direct current developed by Thomas Edison through devices called dynamos, which consist of magnets rotating within the influences of other magnetic fields. As with generators, dynamos include stationary and rotating magnets that respectively build magnetic fields and sever lines of magnetic flux. This process generates the electricity used in most contemporary and developing technologies.Hope this helps u get through ur question !!! ^_~ !!!."

"The Earth's axis completes one full cycle of precession approximately every 26,000 years. At the same time, the elliptical orbit rotates more slowly. The combined effect of the two precessions leads to a 21,000-year period between the astronomical seasons and the orbit. In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit (obliquity) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing.Similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll and others, but verification was difficult due to the absence of reliably dated evidence and doubts as to exactly which periods were important.

Livestock grazing can be used to manage rangelands by harvesting forage to produce livestock, changing plant composition or reducing fuel loads.Fire is also an important regulator of range vegetation, whether set by humans or resulting from lightning. Fires tend to reduce the abundance of woody plants and promote herbaceous plants including grasses, forbs, and grass-like plants. The suppression or reduction of periodic wildfires from desert shrublands, savannas, or woodlands frequently invites the dominance of trees and shrubs to the near exclusion of grasses and forbs."

"Very simply viruses can only reproduce when they encounter a host cell. but cells can reproduce by themselves.Viruses cannot make their own proteins so they ""borrow"" the abilities of a cell to do this for them. They infect a host cell by injecting their DNA into the cell. The virual DNA then takes over the cell and copies the viral DNA to make new viruses. Once there are too many new viruses inside the cell they burst out of the cell (killing it in the process). The new viruses then go on to infect more cells.Cells reproduce by division (mitosis). The cell DNA is copied so there are two sets then the cell divides sharing out the DNA equally. The new cells have excactly the same DNA as the original cell. This process is constantly occurring in your body to grow organs, tissues etc and to repair wounds. Another type of cell division is meiosis which occurs to produce sex cells (eggs and sperm). This is a more complicated process which results in four cells but they only have half the original DNA. Then when a sperm meets an egg cell they join together to make a full set of DNA.."

"Franí_ois-Marie d'Arouet (16941778), better known by his pen name Voltaire, was a French writer and public activist who played a singular role in defining the eighteenth-century movement called the Enlightenment. At the center of his work was a new conception of philosophy and the philosopher that in several crucial respects influenced the modern concept of each. Yet in other ways Voltaire was not a philosopher at all in the modern sense of the term. He wrote as many plays, stories, and poems as patently philosophical tracts, and he in fact directed many of his critical writings against the philosophical pretensions of recognized philosophers such as Leibniz, Malebranche, and Descartes. He was, however, a vigorous defender of a conception of natural science that served in his mind as the antidote to vain and fruitless philosophical investigation. In clarifying this new distinction between science and philosophy, and especially in fighting vigorously for it in public campaigns directed against the perceived enemies of fanaticism and superstition, Voltaire pointed modern philosophy down several paths that it subsequently followed.To capture Voltaire's unconventional place in the history of philosophy, this article will be structured in a particular way. First, a full account of Voltaire's life is offered, not merely as background context for his philosophical work, but as an argument about the way that his particular career produced his particular contributions to European philosophy. Second, a survey of Voltaire's philosophical views is offered so as to attach the legacy of what Voltaire did with the intellectual viewpoints that his activities reinforced.."

"Rococo(/rÎœé ½koè¨koè¨/or/roè¨kÎœé ½koè¨/), less commonlyroccoco, or ""Late Baroque"", is an 18th-century artistic movement and style, affecting many aspects ofthe artsincluding painting, sculpture, architecture, interior design,decoration, literature, music, and theatre. It developed in the early 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry, and strict regulations of theBaroque, especially of thePalace of Versailles.[1]Rococo artists and architects used a more jocular, florid, and graceful approach to the Baroque. Their style was ornate and used light colours, asymmetrical designs, curves, and gold. Unlike the political Baroque, the Rococo had playful and witty themes. The interior decoration of Rococo rooms was designed as a total work of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, andtapestrycomplementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings.By the end of the 18th century, Rococo was largely replaced by theNeoclassicstyle. In 1835 theDictionary of the French Academystated that the wordRococo""usually covers the kind of ornament, style and design associated with Louis XV's reign and the beginning of that of Louis XVI"". It includes therefore, all types of art from around the middle of the 18th century in France. The word is seen as a combination of the Frenchrocaille(stone) andcoquilles(shell), due to reliance on these objects as decorative motifs.[2]The term may also be a combination of the Italian word ""barocco"" (an irregularly shaped pearl, possibly the source of the word ""baroque"") and the French ""rocaille"" (a popular form of garden or interior ornamentation using shells and pebbles) and may describe the refined and fanciful style that became fashionable in parts of Europe in the 18th century.[3]Owing to Rococo love of shell-like curves and focus on decorative arts, some critics used the term to derogatively imply that the style was frivolous or merely modish. When the term was first used in English in about 1836, it was acolloquialismmeaning ""old-fashioned"". The style received harsh criticism and was seen by some to be superficial and of poor taste,[4][5]especially when compared to neoclassicism; despite this, it has been praised for its aesthetic qualities,[4]and since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted byart historians. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style to art in general, Rococo is now widely recognized as a major period in the development ofEuropean art.          i hope that information helps."

"These valves (more generally called the atrioventricular valves) are there to prevent back flow of blood from the ventricles to the atria when the ventricles contract. The same thing happens in both of them:As the ventricles contract, the pressure in the ventricles increases. This, due to the fact that the valves are one way valves, causes the tricuspid and mitral valves to clamp shut.

"Some people describe humid weather as muggy. When the air is humid, it has a lot of water vapor in it. Water as a gas in the atmosphere is called water vapor.    The maximum amount of water vapor that can be in the air depends on the air temperature. Warmer air can hold more water vapor within it. Thatèª²ï½ªs why the muggiest days usually happen at the height of summer heat. But as the temperature goes down, the air can hold less vapor and some of it turns into liquid water.  The amount of water vapor in the air is called absolute humidity. The amount of water vapor in the air as compared with the amount of water that the air could hold is called relative humidity. This amount of space in air that can hold water changes depending on the temperature and pressure. For example, on a warm 76èªF day, you measure that there is half a gram of water vapor for each cubic yard of air. At that temperature, air is able to hold 1 gram of water for each cubic yard of air. So what is the relative humidity? If the air is able to hold twice the amount of water that it does hold, then the relative humidity is 50%.."

"Seismic waves are the vibrations from earthquakes that travel through the Earth; they are recorded on instruments called seismographs. Seismographs record a zig-zag trace that shows the varying amplitude of ground oscillations beneath the instrument. Sensitive seismographs, which greatly magnify these ground motions, can detect strong earthquakes from sources anywhere in the world. The time, locations, and magnitude of an earthquake can be determined from the data recorded by seismograph stations. Earthquakes can be measured through the Richter Scale...Please pick me as Brainliest!!!."

"The East African Rift System (EARS) is one the geologic wonders of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to create new plates by splitting apart old ones. In simple terms, a rift can be thought of as a fracture in the earth's surface that widens over time, or more technically, as an elongate basin bounded by opposed steeply dipping normal faults. Geologists are still debating exactly how rifting comes about, but the process is so well displayed in East Africa (Ethiopia-Kenya-Uganda-Tanzania) that geologists have attached a name to the new plate-to-be; the Nubian Plate makes up most of Africa, while the smaller plate that is pulling away has been named the Somalian Plate (Figure 1). These two plates are moving away form each other and also away from the Arabian plate to the north. The point where these three plates meet in the Afar region of Ethiopia forms what is called a triple-junction. However, all the rifting in East Africa is not confined to the Horn of Africa; there is a lot of rifting activity further south as well, extending into Kenya and Tanzania and Great Lakes region of Africa. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the general geology of these rifts are and highlight the geologic processes involved in their formation.ï¾Šï¾Šï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Ši hope that i have helped today."

They are not meant to guarantee equal results -- but instead proceed on the common-sense notion that if equality of opportunity were a reality, African Americans, women, people with disabilities and other groups facing discrimination would be fairly represented in the nation's work force and educational institutions.The debate over affirmative action demarcates a philosophical divide, separating those with sharply different views of the ""American dilemma"" -- how the nation should treat African Americans, other people of color and women.

Rumors  spread by the Inca Empire as fire on a strange ""bearded man"" who ""lived  in a house on the sea"" and had ""thunder and lightning in his hands."" This strange man began to kill many of the Inca soldiers with diseases brought.When Huayna Capac died, the empire was worn and there was a dispute between his two sons. Cusco,  which was the capital, had been given to the supposed new emperor  Huascar, which was considered as a person horrible, violent and almost  mad attributing to him the murder of his own mother and his sister  forced to marry him. Atahualpa  claimed to be the favorite son of Huayna Capac, since it was given the  territory to the north of modern Quito, Ecuador, why Huascar would have  been very angry. The civil war of succession was fought between the two brothers,  called War of the Two Brothers, in which perished a hundred thousand  people.After  much struggle, Atahualpa defeated Huascar and then, it is said, was  Atahualpa who was crazed and violent, treating losing horribly. Many  were stoned (back) to become disabled, unborn children were torn from  the wombs of mothers, about 1500 members of the royal family, including  the children of Huascar were beheaded and had their bodies hung on  stakes for display. Commoners were tortured.Atahualpa paid a terrible price to become emperor. His empire was now shaken and weakened. It was at this juncture that the ""bearded man"" and his strange arrived, the final scene of the Inca Empire. This  bearded stranger was the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro and his cronies of  ""Castilla de Oro"" which captured Atahualpa and his nobles on November  16, 1532.I hope I was helpfull."

"The most striking difference is the use of ideograms in place of an alphabetic letter system. These were originally pictographs used to represent objects known to the people of ancient china. For instance, the original ancient Chinese symbol for Tiger, Hu, looked just like a simplistic tiger drawing. This was then stylized over the years and morphed into what it looks like today. In addition, Chinese is a tonal language, meaning words are produced with various inflections of the voice--the four main tones are 1) high and flat; 2) rising; 3) falling-rising; and 4) falling.Modern Chinese uses English punctuation and is read right to left and top to bottom. It primarily uses a Subject-Time-Place-Verb-Object sentence structure. This differs from, say, English which uses a Subject-Verb-Object-Place-Time structure. Classic Chinese, on the other hand, did not use punctuation and was read left to right and top to bottom.Chinese is a part of the Sino-Tibetan language group. It is not a part of the large language group known as Indo-European. Many of today's languages are related to this group, including English, Dutch, German, Greek, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. Differences between such language groups usually mean that they developed in areas of geological separation.Another interesting thing about Chinese is that different areas of the brain are used to read it than what is normally used for alphabetic languages.is a tonal language."

"he goal of the bombing campaign was twofold: to destroy the enemies ability to continue to fight by destroying his productive capacity, and to break the morale of the enemy population and cause them to want peace.ï¾ŠAs Allied troops fought their way into Germany in 1944-45, the advancing troops were followed closely by members of a very special group, the Strategic Bombing Survey. Their mission was to assess the effectiveness of the bombing campaign in achieving the two goals. Eminent historian Arthur Schlesinger was a member of the Strategic Bombing Survey. The report the Survey filed was startling. The Survey concluded that the bombing achieved neither of its goals. Though horrific destruction of factories, railroads, bridges, and cities in general was very widespread, German war production was actually rising right up until the end. And though some individual Germans became discouraged and disillusioned, the general morale of the German population never broke.ï¾ŠPart of the problem, the lack of success, was that those directing the bombing could never settle down to a single coherent targeting scheme. At one point the main targets were the German petroleum industry, and had they stuck with that the results might have been decisive, because petroleum is the lifeblood of modern armies. But just when they had the Germans almost crippled, they went on to try something else. Even so at the end of the war, though aircraft production was rising, there was no fuel for the airplanes or to train pilots, and the German army was largely dependent on horse-drawn transportation.ï¾Šï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š ï¾Š i hope that i have helped today."

"Pluto was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh from the United States. An astronomer is a person who studies stars and other objects in space.Pluto was known as the smallest planet in the solar system and the ninth planet from the sun until it was reclassified by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.Today, Pluto is called a dwarf planet. A dwarf planet orbits the sun just like other planets, but it is smaller. It is large enough for its gravity to pull it into the shape of a ball but it is too small to clear other objects and debris out of its path around the sun.On average, Pluto is more than 3.6 billion miles (5.8 billion kilometers) away from the sun. That is about 40 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Pluto orbits the sun in an oval like a racetrack. Because of its oval orbit, Pluto is sometimes closer to the sun than at other times. At its closest point to the sun Pluto is still billions of miles away but is actually closer than Neptune.Pluto is only 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) wide. That's about half the width of the United States. Pluto's diameter is about 2/3 of Earth's moon's diameter.Pluto orbits in a region called the Kuiper (KY-per) Belt. Thousands of small, icy objects like Pluto are in the Kuiper Belt.It takes Pluto 248 years to go around the sun. One day-night cycle on Pluto takes about 6 1/2 day-night cycles on Earth.Pluto was named by an 11-year-old girl from England. This dwarf planet has five moons. Its largest moon is named Charon (KAIR-uhn). Charon is about half the size of Pluto.Pluto has four other, much smaller, moons. They are named Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. They were discovered in 2005, 2005, 2011, and 2012, respectively. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of the new moons. All four are small.They are all less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide.Why Is Pluto Not Called a Planet Anymore?In 2003, an astronomer, Michael Brown, discovered a new object beyond Pluto. He had found a new planet. The object he saw appeared to be larger than Pluto. He named the object Eris (EE-ris).Finding Eris caused other astronomers to talk about what makes a planet a ""planet."" There is a group of astronomers that names objects in space. This group decided that Pluto was not really a planet because of its size and the strength of its gravitational field. So Pluto and objects like it are now called dwarf planets.Pluto is also called a plutoid. A plutoid is a dwarf planet that is farther out in space than the planet Neptune. The three known plutoids are Pluto, Eris, Haumea (HOW-may-ah) and Makemake (MAH-kay-MAH-kay). Astronomers use telescopes to discover new objects like plutoids.Scientists are learning more about the universe and Earth's place in it. What they learn may cause them to think about how objects like planets are grouped. Scientists group objects that are like each other to better understand them. Learning more about faraway objects in the solar system is helping astronomers learn more about what it means to be a planet.What Is Pluto Like?Pluto is very, very cold. The temperature on Pluto is 375 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. Pluto is so far away from Earth that scientists know very little about what it is like. Pictures from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft show that Pluto has mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and maybe glaciers.Pluto has about one-fifteenth the gravity of Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would weigh only 7 pounds on Pluto.Most planets orbit the sun in a near-circle. The sun is in the center of the circle. But Pluto does not orbit in a circle! The orbit of Pluto is shaped like an oval. And the sun is not in the center. Pluto's orbit is also tilted.How Is NASA Exploring Pluto Today?NASA learns about Pluto from pictures and other measurements from telescopes and from the 2015 flyby of its New Horizons spacecraft. Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope helped scientists find the moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Hubble has also taken pictures of Pluto's surface. The pictures show dark and light areas on Pluto. Pluto is so far away that even pictures taken by telescopes in space are a little fuzzy. New Horizons has turned Hubble's fuzzy markings into mountains, plains, craters and other features on Pluto and Charon and shown the shapes and sizes of the four smaller moons.In 2006, NASA launched the first mission to Pluto. It is called New Horizons. New Horizons is a spacecraft that has flown by Pluto, is aiming for a flyby of a small object even more distant from the sun, and then is going continue past the boundary of the solar system into interstellar space. The spacecraft is about the size of a piano. It took nine years to reach Pluto. In 2015, New Horizons arrived at Pluto. The mission spent more than five months studying Pluto and its moons. New Horizons will t."

An example of this is on the Ivory coast where Ivory, for which the coast is named after, is being offloaded in massive quantities.

"The Second World War was history's largest and most significant armed conflict. It served as the breeding ground for the modern structure of security and intelligence, and for the postwar balance of power that formed the framework for the Cold War. Weapons, materiel, and actual combat, though vital to the Allies' victory over the Axis, did not alone win the war. To a great extent, victory was forged in the work of British and American intelligence services, who ultimately overcame their foes' efforts. Underlying the war of guns and planes was a war of ideas, images, words, and impressionsï¾“intangible artifacts of civilization that yielded enormous tangible impact for the peoples of Europe, east Asia, and other regions of the world.Scope and Consequences of the WarThe war pitted some 50 Allied nations, most notable among which were the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China, against the Axis nations. The name ""Axis,"" a reference to the straight geographic line between the capital cities of Rome and Berlin, came from a pact signed by Germany and Italy in 1936, to which Japan became a signatory in 1940. Ultimately a number of other nations would, either willingly or unwillingly, throw in their lot with the Axis, but Germany and Japan remained the principal powers in this alliance.Although the roots of the conflict lay before the 1930s, hostilities officially began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, and ended with the Japanese surrender to the United States six years and one day later. The war can be divided into three phases: 193941, when Axis victory seemed imminent; 194143, when Axis conquests reached their high point even as the tide turned with the U.S. and Soviet entry into the war; and 194345, as the Allies beat back and ultimately defeated the Axis.Over those six years, armies, navies, air units, guerrilla forces, and clandestine units would fight across millions of square miles of sea and land, from Norway's North Cape to the Solomon Islands, and from Iran to Alaska. The war would include more than a dozen significant theatres in western Europe, the north Atlantic, Italy, eastern and southern Europe, Russia, North Africa, China, southern Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific islands. Less major, but still significant, engagements took place in East Africa, the Middle East, and West Africa. There were even extremely limited engagementsï¾“mostly at the level of diplomacy, espionage, or propagandaï¾“in South America and southern Africa.Death toll.ï¾ŠWorld War II and its attendant atrocities would exact an unparalleled human toll, estimated at 50 million military and civilian lives lost. Combat deaths alone add up to about 19 million, with the largest share of this accounted for by 10 million Soviet, 3.5 million German, 2 million Chinese, and 1.5 million Japanese deaths. (The United States lost about 400,000, and the United Kingdom some 280,000.)Adolf Hitler and the Nazis killed another 15.5 million in a massive campaign of genocide that included the ""Final Solution,"" whereby some 6 million Jews were killed. Another 3 million Soviet prisoners of war, along with smaller numbers of Gypsies, homosexuals, handicapped persons, political prisoners, and other civilians rounded out the total. Principal among the Nazi executioners was the SS, led by Heinrich Himmler, which operated a network of slave-labor and extermination camps throughout central and eastern Europe.About 14 million civilian deaths have been attributed to the Japanese. They imposed a system of forced labor on the peoples of the region they dubbed the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,"" and literally worked millions of civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) to death in their camps. The Japanese also conducted massacres of civilians that rivaled those undertaken by the Nazis in Russia.."

"There has been much debate among historians as to why the Nazis set out to exterminate the Jews. Some have stated that it had always been Hitlers plan to exterminate the Jews, while others have perceived the mass murders as a result of a long and curved process, where the Nazi Jewish policy was gradually radicalised.The Jews presence in the German-occupied parts of Europe was seen as a problem and a great annoyance. At best, they were to disappear from the face of the earth, so that the Nazis could reach their goal: a Greater Germany free from Jews. Different solutions were tried: voluntary immigration, forced immigration, and several different plans for deportation. Plans surfaced to deport all the Jews to the east, first to eastern Poland, then to Siberia. Serious plans were also developed that included deporting all European Jews to the east African island of Madagascar.."
Stalin for example put communism into play. With collectivism everyone worked for the state and had to meet quotas. The farmers and people were unable to meet these impossible quotas so they lied and said the quotas were met. This led to Russia selling all the resources and not keeping any because no one mer quotas to be able to feed themselves and sell to countries. This created a huge poverty and millions of people died. So one aspect of communism that failed was that it created poverty. That's all I can think of. Hope this helped..

"Since its independence in 1960, Nigeria has struggled unsuccessfully to clearly articulate the relationship between religion and the state. Whereas the British colonialists seemingly bequeathed to the new nation-state a secular regime at independence, the internal contradictions, which, paradoxically were propagated by the colonial authority, incubated to pose a challenge to the new state soon thereafter. On the one hand, there was the Muslim north, groomed under the English indirect rule, which accommodated the sharia legal order; on the other hand, there was the Christian/Animist south, mentored under the British-secular regime. Thus the post-independence secular state, which seemed acceptable to the Christian/animist south, was abhorred by the Muslim north. This paradox has remained the Achilles' heel of Nigerias corporate existence, as northern Islamists have consistently sought the establishment of an Islamic state to replace the extant secular regime. This article therefore seeks to situate the legal and constitutional frontiers of statereligion relations in Nigeria. It is intent on delineating the conceptual boundary between religion and politics, while evaluating the impact of the current relationship on national security.

"The Yazoo land fraud was one of the most significant events in the postRevolutionary Warï¾Š(1775-83) history of Georgia. The bizarre climax to a decade of frenzied speculation in the state's public lands, the Yazoo sale of 1795 did much to shape Georgia politics and to strain relations with the federal government for a generation.Georgia was too weak after the Revolution to defend its vast western land claims, called the ""Yazoo lands""ï¾ŠJames Jackson and the Yazoo Land Fraudafter the river that flowed through the westernmost part. Consequently, theï¾Šlegislatureï¾Šlistened eagerly to proposals from speculators willing to pay for the right to form settlements there. In the 1780s the state supported two unsuccessful speculative projects to establish counties in the western territory and in 1788 tried, again without success, to cede a portion of those lands to Congress. In 1789 the legislature sold about 25 million acres to three companies, only to torpedo the sale six months later by insisting that payment be made in gold and silver rather than in depreciated paper currency.Pressure to act continued to build on legislators until, by mid-November 1794, a majority reportedly favored the sale of the western territory. On January 7, 1795, Georgiaï¾Šgovernorï¾ŠGeorge Mathewssigned the Yazoo Act, which transferred 35 million acres in present-day Alabama and Mississippi to four companies for $500,000. To achieve this successful sale, the leader of the Yazooists, Georgia's Federalist U.S. senator James Gunn, had arranged the distribution of money and Yazoo land to legislators, state officials, newspaper editors, and other influential Georgians. Cries of bribery and corruption accompanied the Yazoo Act as it made its way to final passage. Angry Georgians protested the sale in petitions and street demonstrations. Despite the swelling opposition, the Yazoo companies completed their purchases.Learning of the circumstances surrounding passag."
"Sign InScientific Laws and PrinciplesScientific MethodScientific ResearchWhy can a scientific theory only be disproven and not proven?Can't we prove gravity? I mean I don't understand why scientists say a scientific theory can never be proven?17 AnswersJoshua Engel34kï¾ŠViewsï¾Šï¾›ï½¢ï¾ŠMost Viewed Writer inï¾ŠScientific Researchï¾Šwithï¾Š120+ answersLet's try it this way. I'm going to write down a pattern:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ?What's the next number? Did you say 13? WRONG. It's 1. Because the pattern I had in mind is the hours of the day, and after 12 comes 1 again.This is a simplistic example, but it's the basic idea behind science. The universe continually throws experiments at you, all the time. And any one of them could be the one that breaks the pattern, no matter how carefully you've observed it and no matter how well your theory has held up so far.ï¾ŠThis is calledï¾ŠUnderdeterminationï¾Šof theory by evidence. Another good article on the subject isï¾ŠUnderdetermination of Scientific Theory. Until you've examined the entire universe, over all of space and time, you can't really say beyond a shadow of a doubt that there isn't some contradiction out there.Gravity is actually an excellent example here. We thought we had a really good theory that was working out great, for about 200 years or so. Then along came Einstein, who figured out a set of circumstances under which that theory would fail. People went looking for that evidence, and they found it. We could say that the old theory was superseded, but remains as a special case, or various other formulations of the same idea, but the key lesson is that even something as obviously universal as gravity could turn out to be incorrect in some extreme circumstance.In practice, this distinction often turns out to be largely semantic. Theories are not proven, but ""accepted"", with the notion that we might retract that acceptance in the face of new data. But that's under-playing the fact that a good theory has been tested many, many, many times, and it's quibbling to act is if there's a serious chance that it's incorrect (especially if you're not actively working on a better theory that also explains just how the old theory managed to survive so long).ï¾ŠSo really, ""can't be proven"" isn't something that has to be taken seriously except at the very far edges of the field. Real work gets done precisely because a theory has held up, and that's the thing that makes a theory worthwhile. A theory that makes guesses that could be wrong, but aren't, tells you something that you didn't already know. A theory that can't possibly be wrong, regardless of what experiment you might perform, isn't actually predicting anything about that experiment.Which means that this is all probably OK, and real scientists don't worry much about this. It's a question for philosophers of science, and the minute it turns up something useful, they should feel free to call us. Until then... it's best left there.."

"Hey There Jess,Why is it necessary for DNA to replicate as the first step in mitosis?DNA has to replicate before mitosis to keep the number of chromosomes and DNA in the cell consistent. Mitosis is the process of reproducing cells by splitting one cell in half to make two. If the DNA didn't replicate, the two daughter cells wouldn't be able to have a complete strand. DNA replicates by dividing in half, then creating a mirror image of itself. Replication gives both strands of DNA anEXACTcopy.For instance, say a cell contains 46 chromosomes (a human body cell). Before dividing in half, it has to double its amount of chromosomes. That way, each offspring cell has the same amount of chromosomes that a normal body cell has. If there weren't the same amount of chromosomes inside all of your body cells, you would have a disability. So, the amount doubles to 92 chromosomes. Then, when the cell splits, each of the offspring again have 46 chromosomes. This is because the chromosomes split equally between the two cells. If it didn't duplicate, the number of chromosomes in each cell would decrease by half each time. This would lead to some cells having a small amount of chromosomes and some cells still having 46. If this occurred, the body would not function properly. This is the same concept with DNA. *REMEMBER* Chromosomes replicate along with the DNA before mitosis begins.."

"The Second World War was history's largest and most significant armed conflict. It served as the breeding ground for the modern structure of security and intelligence, and for the postwar balance of power that formed the framework for the Cold War. Weapons, materiel, and actual combat, though vital to the Allies' victory over the Axis, did not alone win the war. To a great extent, victory was forged in the work of British and American intelligence services, who ultimately overcame their foes' efforts. Underlying the war of guns and planes was a war of ideas, images, words, and impressionsï¾“intangible artifacts of civilization that yielded enormous tangible impact for the peoples of Europe, east Asia, and other regions of the world.Scope and Consequences of the WarThe war pitted some 50 Allied nations, most notable among which were the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China, against the Axis nations. The name ""Axis,"" a reference to the straight geographic line between the capital cities of Rome and Berlin, came from a pact signed by Germany and Italy in 1936, to which Japan became a signatory in 1940. Ultimately a number of other nations would, either willingly or unwillingly, throw in their lot with the Axis, but Germany and Japan remained the principal powers in this alliance.Although the roots of the conflict lay before the 1930s, hostilities officially began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, and ended with the Japanese surrender to the United States six years and one day later. The war can be divided into three phases: 193941, when Axis victory seemed imminent; 194143, when Axis conquests reached their high point even as the tide turned with the U.S. and Soviet entry into the war; and 194345, as the Allies beat back and ultimately defeated the Axis.Over those six years, armies, navies, air units, guerrilla forces, and clandestine units would fight across millions of square miles of sea and land, from Norway's North Cape to the Solomon Islands, and from Iran to Alaska. The war would include more than a dozen significant theatres in western Europe, the north Atlantic, Italy, eastern and southern Europe, Russia, North Africa, China, southern Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific islands. Less major, but still significant, engagements took place in East Africa, the Middle East, and West Africa. There were even extremely limited engagementsï¾“mostly at the level of diplomacy, espionage, or propagandaï¾“in South America and southern Africa.Death toll.ï¾ŠWorld War II and its attendant atrocities would exact an unparalleled human toll, estimated at 50 million military and civilian lives lost. Combat deaths alone add up to about 19 million, with the largest share of this accounted for by 10 million Soviet, 3.5 million German, 2 million Chinese, and 1.5 million Japanese deaths. (The United States lost about 400,000, and the United Kingdom some 280,000.)Adolf Hitler and the Nazis killed another 15.5 million in a massive campaign of genocide that included the ""Final Solution,"" whereby some 6 million Jews were killed. Another 3 million Soviet prisoners of war, along with smaller numbers of Gypsies, homosexuals, handicapped persons, political prisoners, and other civilians rounded out the total. Principal among the Nazi executioners was the SS, led by Heinrich Himmler, which operated a network of slave-labor and extermination camps throughout central and eastern Europe.About 14 million civilian deaths have been attributed to the Japanese. They imposed a system of forced labor on the peoples of the region they dubbed the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,"" and literally worked millions of civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) to death in their camps. The Japanese also conducted massacres of civilians that rivaled those undertaken by the Nazis in Russia.."

"The Founding Fathers got this one wrong. They were pretty smart guysï¾“they got the whole separation of powers and checks and balances things rightï¾“but they completely missed the boat on political parties.

Stalin for example put communism into play. With collectivism everyone worked for the state and had to meet quotas. The farmers and people were unable to meet these impossible quotas so they lied and said the quotas were met.
