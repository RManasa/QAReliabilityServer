In the classical theory, light is a wave that gives energy. This energy gradually helps the electron jump to a higher energy level.\nIn quantum theory, this is wrong; an electron cannot absorb a small amout of energy because there is not close enough state to jump to with that energy; only very specific amounts of energy lead to a change in orbital levels/ absorbance of energy. Also, each pair of energy levels has a specific energy difference that is needed from an electron so that it can move. \nHence, B is correct; all other sentences describe classical models of light-electron interactions\n\n", "rating": 5, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 1, "num_thanks": 2}], "top_answer": {"question": "How does quantum theory explain the emission spectra of atoms? \n\nA.
