They were so big and clean I just kept thinking \u201chow I wish I could drive one like that\u201d! I asked my parents if they knew what type of vehicle it was unfortunately they were not into cars and were too busy to even look at the vehicle and give me a response, it didn\u2019t matter, I took a memory picture and it kept it for many years to come. \nI remember that when I left my grandma\u2019s house the car was no longer there, I kept wondering who did that car belonged to. I mean, after all everyone who lived in that area were not wealthy and most of them didn\u2019t even owned a car. Maybe a guest I that comes to visit someone around there I thought to myself. The following weekend came and it was time to visit to visit my grandma again, I remember this time I went with my older brother who at the time was 22, I drove him crazy about the car I had seen, so much so to the point that he agreed to come along with us. \nAs we get o my grandma\u2019s house I see the beautiful black car parked on the same saw it parked the weekend before, It is a CHEVY!

Immediately we backed up and said ...\u201dNo. No sir! Just looking at the car it looks like those on the action movies! The guy approached us and asked us if we wanted to sit inside the car! Of course we said yes. As the time went by, my older brother askes the guy how he could afford such a car, he explained to us that he brought it crashed and almost destroyed for pennies, eventually and little by little he was able to buy the parts and fix it on its own. \nMy brother and I looked at each other and I knew it was the beginning of something, my brother told me that night that he would be doing the same, and he would start saving as much as he could and will buy a vehicle and little by little fix it. It seem so much easier and less expensive but we had no experienced on mechanics, all we need was collecting car toys. A year after that my bother purchased a Volkswagen beetle, it didn\u2019t drive but it was all we could afford $100. We pushed the car to our house and it want until 3 years after that we were able to get it back like new. It drove, looked nice and we sold it for much more than $100. \nWith that money, we were able to continue doing so, we grew and decided to open a small company where we sold used cars to people with low income. It got to the point where we had almost 2 to 3 cars parked outside the house.\nPeople would come and ask us for more cars.
