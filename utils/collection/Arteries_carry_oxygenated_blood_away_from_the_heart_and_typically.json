The arterial blood is oxygenated and this process ensures that every tissue around the body will receive oxygen and nutrients through this blood flow. \n\nVeins are also part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying the deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart. \n\nVenous pressure is much lower than the arterial pressure. More specifically, venous pressure ranges from 5 to 8 mmHg, while arterial pressure ranges from 15 to 30 mmHg. \n", "rating": 0, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 0, "num_thanks": 0}], "top_answer": {"question": "Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and typically have ________________ blood pressure.
