The lines from this excerpt that suggest that Mr. Darcy is questioning his hasty judgment and has fallen in love with Elizabeth are the following one: ""But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes."" This is the moment he realized that he was wrong about her and that there is more to her than he originally thought. He realized that he has already fallen in love with her, despite her flaws.

"If the United States imports more goods from Japan than it exports to Japan, how will the difference be financed? The United States will sell the assets they receive so that Americans who want the product are obligate to pay for future imports of those items. Basically, the United States will make sure Americans are wanting and willing to pay for the items they are importing for us to have from Japan or they will stop important those items.

heart disease is caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries that
supply blood to the heart. when the flow of blood to the heart is
restricted or blocked, the heart can be damaged due to a lack of oxygen.
further, if a large piece of plaque buildup gets dislodged from an
artery wall, it can get stuck in other arteries throughout the body,
including arteries in the brain. for simplicity, let's assume that the
artery is cylindrical with a radius of r. the flow rate of a viscous

No slavery wasn't a choice... 

Many slaves were beaten if they rebelled or tried to get their own rights. Children were born into slavery meaning that that's all the knew. Most owners didn't teach their slaves to read or write, so slaves couldn't easily survive on their own because they weren't educated enough to get a job.

The civil war showed how slaves didn't have a choice or rights even though they desperately wanted them, and even after the war their was segregation. Slaves didn't have a choice or a voice.

Answer//////////Prosocial behaviors;///////////////
"

Prosocial behaviors is correct

"
"t1/2 = ln 2 / λ = 0.693 / λ
Where t1/2 is the half life of the element and λ is decay constant.

32 = 0.693 / λ 
λ   = 0.693 / 32          (1) 

Nt = Nο eΛ(-λt)          (2)

Where Nt is atoms at t time, λ is decay constant and t is the time taken.
t = 1.9 hours = 1.9 x 60 min

From (1) and (2),


Nt = Nο e⁻Λ(0.693/32)*1.9*60
Nt =  0.085Nο 

Percentage = (Nt/Nο) x 100%
                   = (0.085Nο/Nο) x 100%
                   = 8.5%

Hence, Percentage of remaining atoms with the original sample is 8.5%

The hummingbird's nutritional needs daily are 10,000 mg of sugar and 8,000 mg of protein. 

Since one nasturtium flower provides 10 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 1000 nasturtium flowers each day for its nutritional needs (10,000/10 = 1000). 
Since one honeysuckle flower provides 20 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 500 honeysuckle flowers each day for its nutritional needs. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on nasturtium flowers, then the bird will need 5,000 seconds to get exactly the food it needs. This is calculated based on the information that it takes 5 seconds to feed on a nasturtium: 1000 flowers daily * 5 seconds = 5000 sec = 83,3 min. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on honeysuckle flowers, then the bird will need: 500 flowers * 20 seconds = 10,000 sec = 166,6 min.

You can look at this problem step by step. 
First step: Probability that the first pick is male = 10/20   (as 10 males out of 20 people)
2nd step: Probability that the second pick is male= 9/19 (as there are 9 males left out of 19 people) 
3rd step: P = 8/18
4th step: P = 7/17

As these all need to happen once you need to multiply the probabilities. 

The result is: 10/20 * 9/19 * 8/18 * 7/17
You can simplify this if you wish.

What is the question
"
"
Since it is geometric sequence, we know that a₄ = a₁ r³ and a₆ = a₁ r⁵

So we have a₆ / a₄ = a₁ r⁵ / a₁ r³ = r²

Also a₆ / a₄ = 64 / 16 = 4

So r would be either 2 or -2. Let's go with 2 for now.

Now let's find a₁.

a₄ / r = a₃ = 16 / 2 = 8

a₃ / r = a₂ = 8 / 2 = 4

a₂ / r = a₁ = 4 /2 = 2

So S₄ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30

So final answer: S₄ = 30

Hope this helps.

Mean is the same thing as average
example
the mean of 30 and 40 is 35 because (30+40)/2=70/2=35

mean absolue deviation is when you take the mean of the set
then you find the diffference of each number of the set then take the mean of that
ex if yo uhave 1,2,3,4,5 and the mean is 3, then ou find the absolute value of the difference of each
|1-3|=2
|2-3|=1
|3-3|=0
|4-3|=1
|5-3|=2
add them and divide by 5
(2+1+0+1+2)/5=6/5= MAD=6/5

basically it tells how spread out the graph is or how close the points are to the mean
so the smaller mean average deviation, the closer the points are to the mean
the bigger it is, the farther they are

so if they had the points 1,2,3,4,5 and mean is 3 and MAD=6/5, 6/5 is small so therefor the points are close to that number
if I had the points 1,1,1,2,5,5 and the mean was 3 and MAD=11/5, 11/5 is bigger than 6/5 and therefor the points are more spread out


therefor the math scores are closer togeher
science is farther apart

if you mean that the highest grade in math was compared witht eh highest grade in science, then science is higher since the plots are more spread out

since math had a smaller MAD than science, the points are closer together

so the answers are C and D

D) D is incorrect; Neanderthals were a hominid species and a relatively advanced one since they lived very closely in time to homo sapiens (modern man). Neanderthals used to live in Europe and had been living there before modern man came from Africa.
C) This is not precise. While it could have been used as a weapon, nowhere in the passage can we see a hint for that. It might have helped modern humans in other ways, making them more reliably survive cold periods and thus displacing the resident Neanderthals.
B) This is also not precise. While the passage implies that fire might have been an important factor for the migration, quite possibly there could be other important aspects of migration to learn. Also, the passage says ""may have helped"", it is not too definitive.
A) THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. The only concrete fact of the passage is the fact that Neandertals went extinct after the arrival of the modern man. The passage in whole is arguing that since fire is so important in Europe and the Neanderthals did not have access to it, we could attribute their extinction to the modern humans having fire as a competitive advantage.

In order to help the
student expand his/her knowledge I will help answer the question. This in hope
that the student will get a piece of knowledge that will help him through his
homework or future tests.

I will list the four
bills that were sent to Congress implementing Roosevelt’s New Deal. These were
the four bills: Federal Emergency Relief Act, The Social Security Act, Emergency
Banking Act, and The Agricultural Adjustment Act.

I hope it helps,
Regards."
"
Among these bills, you can pick up
the Social Security Act for sure. This particular one entails the minimum
amount of purchasing capacity that beneficiaries from this policy can take
advantage of (crucial government decision to set up the economic virtuous
circle). Moving on, you can also pick the Stock Market Security Act. Given the
financial mayhem taken place in Wall Street by the later 20’s, the U.S. corresponding
authorities effectively pulled off a better regulation of the stockbrocking
activity.

Research Confirmation is not one of the following six stages:Stage 1- 
claimsmaking 
- individuals make guarantees that there is a social issue, with certain attributes, causes and arrangements 
Normal History model of the social issues process: 
Stage 2- 
media scope 
- media investigate claimsmakers with the goal that news of the cases contacts a more extensive gathering of people 
Common History model of the social issues process: 
Stage 3- 
Open Reaction 
- general assessment centers around the social issue recognized by claims producers 
Normal History model of the social issues process: 
Stage 4- 
policymaking 
- administrators and others w/the ability to set strategies make better approaches to address the issue 
Normal History model of the social issues process: 
Stage 5- 
Social issues work 
- offices execute the new arrangements, including calls for additionally changes 
Common History model of the social issues process: 
Stage 6- 
Approach Outcomes 
- there are different reactions to the new course of action

Concentration refers to how much of a chemical is present in a given solution. 

Consider two beakers with 200cm^3 of water. One has 10g of salt, the other one has 50g of salt. The beaker with the 50g of salt is more concentrated/has a higher concentration because there is much more of the solute in the same amount of solvent.

I found your options which you did not include and the answer is that the

and they should be considered as equal as they are in nature.

 Here Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage argue that man and women are made for each other and they complement each other and both can equally fulfill all of the ordinary human activities and duties. So they argue not that women should be superior but that they be treated equally.

It takes 1.58 seconds.

The equation to represent this is of the form h(t) = -16t²+v₀t+h₀, where -16 is the gravitational constant, v₀ is the initial velocity, and h₀ is the initial height.  We do not have an initial velocity, since the balloon is dropped.  The initial height is 40.  This gives us the function
h(t) = -16t² + 40.

We will set this equal to 0:
0 = -16t² + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides:
0-40 = -16t² + 40 - 40
-40 = -16t²

Divide both sides by -16:
-40/-16 = -16t²/-16
2.5 = t²

Take the square root of both sides:
√2.5 = √t²
1.58 = t

Let x and y be the rate per hour for Mechanic 1 and 2 respectively.

Then,
x+y=205 ---------- (1)
Additionally,
10x+15y = 2500 ------ (2)

Solving equations 1 and 2;
Multiply (1) by 10 and subtract two from the result,
10x+10y = 2050
10x +15 y =2500
----------------------
        -5 y = --450 => y = 450/5 = $90
Then,
x= 205-90 = $115

Therefore,
Mechanic 1 charged $115 per hour
Mechanic 2 charged $90 per hour

Negative reinforcement refers to a learning process whereby a behavior or response is reinforced and much more likely to be repeated in the future if a negative outcome is avoided or removed as a result of performing the behavior.

C is incorrect because using 'when' and 'that same year' in the same sentence is grammatically incorrect.

Most robots have no interest in harming the human population at all; they existto aid people in making life safer, healthier, and more productive. Working together, humans and robots can get the job done. There are robots on Earth that exist specifically to boost human health. With the help of robots, scientists are working to create an exoskeleton that will attach itself to the outside of the human body, establishing a connection to the human brain.

Main Ideas:
I. Robots are not villians. They are here to help everyone.
II. Robots are great helpers in everything. They make human's work easier.
III. Robots also work out in space to ensure the safety of human life. (Don't add this, but think of how many humans have died out there in space... it's dangerous)
IV. Robots and machines can even recreate or support human health. (This can be found in the second to last sentence in that paragraph).
V. We shouldn't be so negative with robots because of the influence of movies. Robots are the next generation of help in future years to come.

1. Not exactly the first animated film, but is considered to be the first animated feature film was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" It was the first film created that was completely hand-drawn. His previous works were usually made using cutouts and stop motion. 

2. There were actually two big honchos of the film industry who were interested in Alexander Schure's Work. One of them was Francis Ford Coppola, director of , ""The Godfather."" The other one was George Lucas, the creator of, ""Star Wars."" So your answer would be D.

3. A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations and/or images. They are arranged in a sequence so that the animators can pre-visualize the sequence of events and actions and dialogues of each event. It serves as a blueprint for the whole film. 

4.  3-D printing has been hailed as the phenomenon that will bring forth the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Much like the previous revolution, 3-D printing will take global income levels to the next step. Rendering services more efficiently was one of the highlights of technology, with regards to digital media. However, 3-D printing will also be able to drive the supply-side of the economy.

5. 3-D printing is the process of making physical objects from a three dimensional model. The are made by joining materials and solidifying them through computer control. Layers of the material are laid out one by one in succession to create the object. So your answer is A.

6. The first video game console was made by Atari. Atari Pioneered the home video game console industry. One of its earliest products was a game called ""Pog,"" created by Allan Alcorn. Pong was the first commercially successful video game. The answer is C.

7. The kids of the 1980s basically played with two-dimensional sticks, dots, and quadrilateral-shaped characters is false. The 1980's was the kick off years of video gaming. Although still mostly in 2D, graphic designs were much more advanced and around 1987, 3D games were introduced. 
 

8. France and Japan produced some of the earliest examples of animation. French animation dates back to the early 19th Century. The first Japanese animation was said to have first come out around the 1910's. Verifiable films though were dated to at least 1917.

9. The CAD that we use today is different from the CAD that was used in the 1980's. The introduction of PC, tablets, and smartphones have greatly influenced the potentials and used of CAD. Mostly used in the engineering industry in the past, CAD is now used across many fields and other industries. So your answer is False.

11. Steven Spielberg is an Academy Award Winning director, producer, and screenwriter. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the film industry of all time. He has won 3 Academy awards and was nominated for 7 for the Best Director Category.

12. Pixar Animation Studios, is a computer animation film studio that produced 19 feature films. The very first computer animation film that was produced by Pixar was Toy Story in 1995. They also produced Monster's Inc in 2001, and Finding Nemo in 2003. 

13. 3-D modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence will allow for law-enforcement agents to recreate crime scenes. The Hong Kong Police already use this technique to better understand court cases. They also use it to plan raids and assess terrorist threats.  

14. It was Alexander Schure who founded the New Institute of Technology. He wished to be the next, ""Walt Disney,"" of film making. However, he did not have the same creative mind as Disney when it came to making story lines. So the answer to that question is false. 

15. Robotics is the branch of engineering that deals with the building of robots. They deal with the design, concept, manufacturing and operations of robots. So with that definition, you could say that  robotics team is a group or team that work together to build robots. You answer is A."

So basically you have a class, and within that class you have methods and instance variables; very much like how object oriented programming works in other languages. However, the main difference is that the class constructor in Python is defined right within the class object and is denoted by the method name, ""__init__"" and requires a parameter of ""self"". 
Ex:
class Py:
    def __init__(self):
          constructor code...
The __init__ method is what is called first when an object of the class is instantiated. The way you instantiate an object is by the following:
object_name = Py()

If you wanted to make your class more useful, you could add more parameters to your __init__ constructor, so when an object is created you can pass arguments to that object:
class Py:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
         self.name = name
         self.age = age
         print ""Your name is %s and you are %d years old"" % (name, age)
def main():
     Bob = Py(""Bob"", 23)
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
     main()

This code would give you: Your name is Bob and you are 23 years old

Following the balance amount:
$205.84 + $98.42 - $18.63 - $25 = $260.63 
Brent Tyson would have a remaining balance of $260.63 for that month. With finance charges calculated at 1.5% per month of the unpaid balance, we calculate $260.63 + ($260.63 x 0.015) = $264.539.

In this chapter, Nick Carraway details the sort of people attending Gatsby's fortnightly lavish parties. As expected these extravagantly large events would be attended by the rich, famous, powerful, most opulent of all in the society. There is, somehow, a divide between ""old money"" and ""new money"" from different parts of America. Here the concept of American dream is at work. ""New money"" folks worked their way to achieve that American dream. The ""old money"" rich do not necessarily approve of them, but they swam in the same circles still. Even in the highest rank of the society, there is still hierarchy at work.

The vertices of the current cover are:

 The vertices of the design are:
 R (3, 0); S (0, 0); T (0, 4); U (3, 4)
 We then have the following relationship:
 ((1/4) x ', ((1/4) y') -----> (x, y)
 Equivalently:
 (1/4) R '= R
 (1/4) S '= S
 (1/4) T '= T
 (1/4) U '= U
 Therefore, the points are proportional and the proportionality constant is:

From 1861-1863, the Confederate army was winning the Civil War. The South had better generals and defensive strategies while the North military leaders argued with their political
leaders.

from 1863-1865, the
weight of the Northern population and industrial capacity turned the war. South lost its best general, Jackson while the North army was led by Grant. The Emancipation
Proclamation freed all slaves in Confederate territories and Inspired Southern slaves to escape which forced
Southern whites to worry about their farms.

The Civil War ended by 1865 due to Grant's leadership and appointment of Sherman to lead the Southern campaign. The South lost the war subsequent to the loss at Gettsbury in 1863.

"According to the indictment against him, Charles Schenck tried to send something through the mail illegally.

Charles Schenck was a Socialist Party leader in the US who opposed US participation in World War I.  He mailed pamphlets to men who'd been drafted that said the government had no right to send American citizens to war to kill people in other countries.  Schenck was convicted of violating the Espionage Act, which had been passed by Congress in 1917.

Schenck appealed his case to the Supreme Court, saying the Espionage Act was unconstitutional.   In the 1919 decision in Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction against Schenck.  Thus the Court essentially upheld the constitutionality of the Espionage Act at that time, saying that in wartime the government has extra responsibility to protect the safety of the nation.  The decision, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, said, ""The question in every case is whether the words are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.""

V=(4/3)pir^3
SA=4pir^2

so

given
v=1331
1331=(4/3)pir^3
times both sides by 3/4
998.25=pir^3
divide both sides by pi
998.25/pi=r^3
cube root both sides
∛(998.25/pi)=r

ok
SA=4pir^2
SA=4pi(∛(998.25/pi))²
SA=4pi(∛(996503.0625/(pi²)))
SA=4pi∛(996503.0625/(pi²))

I guess the problem is asking for the induced emf in the coil.

Faraday-Neumann-Lenz states that the induced emf in a coil is given by:

where
N is the number of turns in the coil
 is the variation of magnetic flux through the coil
 is the time interval

The coil is initially perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, so the initial flux through it is given by the product between the magnetic field strength and the area of the coil:

At the end of the time interval, the coil is parallel to the field, so the final flux is zero:


Therefore, we can calculate now the induced emf by using the first formula:

There were a lot of social, political and economic impacts of the Revolutionary War (aka the American Revolution), considering American culture. For example, democracy was introduced to America, leaving behind their monarchy. Another example is that women are now seen to have more of a say and rights to do other things that men would normally carry out, such as starting a career. A final example is that slavery is also taken more seriously nowadays due to this incredible war. Slavery was a horrific issue during the revolution, with hundreds that suffered fatally.

Burmese Pythons are an invasive species which means they are not native to the ecosystem they are currently in. This means that the pythons have no natural predators and can easily deplete food sources for other organisms in that ecosystem. Less food for other organisms results in rapid population loss of species that are native to that ecosystem.

>Someone releases Burmese Pythons in the Everglades.

"Answer: 57

=====================================================

Explanation:

Convert each raw score to a z score
If x = 63.4, then
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (63.4-72.3)/8.9
z = -1

if x = 81.2, then 
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (81.2-72.3)/8.9
z = 1

So P(63.4 < x < 81.2) is the same as P(-1 < z < 1)

Through the empirical rule (aka the 68-95-99.7 rule), we know that roughly 68% of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean. In other words
P(-1 < z < 1) = 0.68 approximately (see note below)

Multiply 0.68 by the total 84 to get
0.68*84 = 57.12
which rounds to 57 people

Note: we can use a calculator to get a more accurate result of 0.68268949; a data table works as well but it won't be as accurate. For the purposes of this problem, the value 0.68 is good enough

Anatomical And Embryonic Evidence Of Evolution

Introduction to Evidence for Evolution

Comparing the anatomy of different species is one major type of evidence for evolution. The main areas of comparative anatomy are anatomical and embryonic evidence.

Anatomical- bone structure

Embryonic- development of unborn organisms


Anatomical Evidence

Anatomical evidence compares the bones structures of various species.
Types of structures:

Homologous- same structure, different function

Analogous - same function, different structure

Vestigial - no function, leftover from ancestor


Embryonic Evidence

Embryos are unborn, developing organisms that often look very different in adult form. Many different species have similar looking embryos, which means early traits are shared between many species. The conclusion is evolutionary relatedness.

Total volume of the tank is 5000 cubic units
Volume of liquid=60%*5000=3000 cubic units
the height of the fluid will be found as follows
V=πr²h
where:
r=20/2=10 units
hence:plugging in the values and solving for h we get:
3000=π×(10²)×h
thus
h=3000/(100π)
h=9.5292966
h=9.5293 units

B. Trivial vs crucial decisions.

The story mentions family and he did command a ship but a theme is a general, underlying thing that shapes the story itself. The navy guy wouldn't be feeling any of this if he hadn't seen suffering and violence and stress during his time at war. So it influences his behaviour with his family/friends at home. Therefore, the theme of the story is about the importance of life decisions. He no longer views these minute things (like vacation spots and home decor) as important.

"Zimbardo's simulation of prison life provided a dramatic demonstration of the power of ""roles"" on behavior. 


There are numerous ways that individuals can impact our behavior, yet maybe a standout amongst the most imperative is that the nearness of others appears to set up desires. One manner by which these desires wind up obvious is the point at which we take a gander at the parts that individuals play in the public eye. Social parts are the part individuals play as individuals from a social gathering. With every social part you receive, your conduct changes to fit the desires both you and others have of that part.

The House un-American Activities Committee founded to investigate communistic activity in American following WWI often targeted Hollywood actors/actresses and writers. As artists tend to be expressive and creative, their work was often pinpointed as non-American. As threats of being blacklisted grew, many artists conformed to American ideals and values as their way of protecting themselves. Consequently, pop culture was conformist and met the demands of government which wanted ""normalcy"". The goals of sitcoms was to demonstrate the proper American values of family, hard work, and patriotism. It is youth generations in the mid-to-late 1950s which will begin to challenge this conformity through beatnik writing and rock-n-roll music.

"Initially, the patriots
who fought lacked military training.  The
British were veterans of several wars both in the colonies and abroad.  They were disciplined and mastered battle
formations as well as being well-equipped. 
However, the many who joined the war were seasoned hunters and their
weapons were rifled muskets that fire farther and are more accurate.  When they failed at traditional means of
warfare, they fell back on their hunting skills and used that to fight the
British.  Later officers like Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben trained Washington’s
troops who became more disciplined and this helped them win the war."

 For Jupiter:
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * (r2 ^ 3)
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * ((44423) ^ 3)
 Dividing both equations we have:
 v2 / v1 = ((44423) ^ 3) / ((3960) ^ 3)
 v2 / v1 = 1411.685958

Warning: The following statements are partial speculation. Make of them what you will and hopefully they will help you generate an adequate answer. 

-Individuals with clinical depression are less likely to go out, as they feel less inclined to socialize and are likely to lose the drive to leave their homes and perform daily tasks. Your body needs exercise and neglecting to use it can't be good.

-People who are depressed are more likely to develope eating disorders such as anorexia and binge eating. Both place strain on the heart and body in multiple ways. 

- If you understand how a Placebo works, you know that how how a person feels physically can be linked to mentality. If an individual thinks they are being given a life saving medicine when they are only receiving a sugar tablet, their health may still inprove slightly. By this logic, we can assume an individual with a declining mental health has a chance to show a decline in physical health.

I believe the correct answer is B.Great loss must be endured before great things can happen; Aunt Gold Teeth knows this is a test and responds by throwing away her Christian items.

Gold Teeth is an Indian woman who is torn between Hinduism and Christianity; her need to pray was very strong, although it was enough to save her husband from death. She does also blame herself for his death and for the fact that she does not have children, but as her Grandmother said, perhaps this tragic event is what was needed to bring her back to her faith for the Hindu Gods. 

"
"
The answer is A: Aunt Gold Teeth blames herself for her failure to serve her husband and have children; her failure to accomplish this is due to her lack of faith.

The answer is ""the dream"".

Maybe the greatest contrast amongst people, and between gatherings of ladies, concerns what Dr. Levinson called ''The Dream.'' Between ages 22 and 28, a young fellow designs a speculative life structure. He shapes a fantasy: his vision of himself on the planet, his objectives and desires. The dreams are for the most part identified with occupation, said Dr. Levinson. He'll be a boxer, a supervisor or a football star - the legend of his own story. Ladies have more prominent trouble shaping the dream, he said.

The answer is letter B, etymology.


Etymology refers to the way in which origins of words are
traced back.  Words change their meanings
through the course of time, this is why learning its history and its lineage is
important in the process of etymology.  Language,
just like our physical bodies, evolves through time and they may sometimes
depend on the historical events that occur within specific areas. People adapt
to these events and coin words based on their experiences.  "

Fashion is a strong force that has always played a significant role in the evolution of mankind’s society. As far back as the Egyptian, Greek and Roman Empires, fashion was a key social element that reflected the society through apparel, accessories and cosmetics. Fashion also had an influence on decisions regarding politics, economy, education and art. In the ancient Roman Empire, the visual representation of fashion was so ingrained within the society that the ruling government decreed the models and colours of shoes worn by the members of each social class. Also during the early years of industrialization, wealthy Americans and Asians travelled to Europe to acquire luxury goods, boosting international trade and the expansion of the global economy. In addition, the Grand Nobles of the Renaissance period and the aristocrats of the past centuries all stamped their significance and contribution to society’s evolution through fashion. The fashion tradition remains prevalent today, albeit in a modern way."

Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his New Deal, made one of the most popular social programs to help the elderly. This is called the Social Security Administration. 

The Social Security Administration still exists today. This program provides direct financial assistance (aka money) to elderly American citizens. All American citizens pay into this system through taxes and are able to receive money from this agency once they reach a certain age. This program also results in the development of each citizen having a social security number, which is an important piece of information that allows the government to keep records of American citizens.

Molality is defined as the number of moles of solute in 1 kg of solvent.
molality of solution to be prepared is 0.50 molal
this means that in 1000 g of water there should be 0.50 mol of NaCl
if 1000 g of water should contain - 0.50 mol 
then 750.0 g of water requires - 0.50 mol/kg x 0.750 kg = 0.375 mol
mass of NaCl in 0.375 mol - 58.5 g/mol x 0.375 mol = 21.9 g

It depends on how the colors are located.. but you solve by twisting the rubik's cube over and over again and trying to get 3 rows of the same together on one side of the rubrics cube.that way some colors that u did not solve yet . might be matched up a little. and so the goal is to try and get all 6 sides of the rubric cube have the same color :)
"
"1) Choose one face to start with. 
 Lets start with the color white as the first layer.
2) Solve the cross.
Find the side with the white square in the center and put it on top. Set into position the four edge pieces that contain white. (You should be able to do this by yourself without needing algorithms.) All four edge pieces can be placed in a maximum of eight moves (five or six in general). Place the cross at the bottom. Turn the cube over 180° so that the cross is now on the bottom.

3) Solve the four corners of the first layer, one by one. 
At the end of this step, the first layer should be complete, with a solid color (in this case, white) at the bottom.

"The inner membrane is responsible for cellular respiration and thus, contains proteins involved in electron transport and ATP synthesis. This membrane envelops the mitochondrial matrix, where the electrons are produced (the citric acid cycle) and then travel from one protein complex to the next in the inner membrane (electron transport chain). The final electron acceptor is O2, and this ultimately forms H2O. At the same time, the electron transport chain produces ATP (oxidative phosphorylation via ATP synthase). ATP synthase uses concentration gradient of H+ (formed during electron transport), power synthesis of the energy molecule-ATP. Liver cells (hepatocytes) need a lot of ATP energy, for the processes like protein and other synthesis, protein storage, the transformation of carbohydrates…"

To my opinion, the key to happiness is inside all of us.
First of all, happiness comes from inside, and even if it could depend on exterior factors, we will not be happy unless we know where to find it. Most of us think that if we buy what we wish the most, or if we are rich, we are happy. But it is just a misconception. Happiness does not depend on objects, but on feelings.
Secondly, happiness is just like a locked door. To find the key to it, we find the door first, and to do that, we just need to know ourselves better. To help people, and by seeing their smiles, we will feel a warmth inside. That is happiness. 
There is not just one key - people are all different, and each of them has a different key, a different purpose, and a different door to open.
Happiness is a choice. And when we realise this, we are very close to find its key too.
To sum up, I would say that all we have to do in order to find the key to happiness is to open our eyes properly, and to see what the majority cannot see.

1. A transgenic organism expresses DNA that has been derived from another species. These organisms have altered genomes and are generated in the laboratory for the purposes of research, for example, the ""knock-out"" mice are tansgenic mice with a particular gene of interest disabled. 
2. Recombinant DNA is the DNA that has been altered to contain genes, or portions of genes, from different organisms. The DNA molecules are formed in the lab using recombination methods to bring together genetic material from multiple sources and therefore creating sequences that are not found in the genome. 
3. Restriction enzymes are found naturally in bacteria and they cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. These enzymes are also called restriction endonucleases, they cleave DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites called restriction sites. They are found in bacteria and archaea and they serve to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses.
4. Biotechnology is the use or alteration of organisms, cells, or biological molecules to produce food, drugs, or other goods. Living systems and organisms are used to make or develop products. Biotechnology enhances cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and product for the purposes of improving life and health. 
5. Polymerase chain reaction is a technique that is used to quickly synthesize billions of copiies of a specific segment of DNA.  It is a quick and a very efficient way to generate many copies of DNA.  The process is applicable when there are small quantities of DNA to analyze. The events of PCR involves; separation of DNA strands, addition of primers, use of DNA polymerase to produce second strand of DNA. 
6. In the process known as transformation, bacteria take up pieces of DNA from the surroundings. Bacterial transformation results from the uptake of naked DNA (DNA without associated cells or proteins). Transformation may also occur naturally in some species of bacteria.

A linocut is a type of relief print. Relief printing is when a piece of paper is “stamped” with ink from the top surface of the plate.
Other types of relief prints are woodcuts and engraving. Essentially, a linocut is the same as a woodcut but the plate isn’t wood, it’s a piece of linoleum, and because of the softness of the plate, it is easier to carve.
When you carve your lino you are cutting away the area that will be white and leaving the area that will be black (or coloured if you are printing in colour). Linocuts were originally made popular by Picasso, while before that they were simply regarded as a student’s medium to practise for woodcuts.
"
"
Why is it already answered within the question? not that im complaining.... is it so that we can have free points or somethin??? in that case....... Making a Linocut basically your taking your design and using the negative space to paint the same picture over and over. It is a very easy and effective method to use.How ever it´s main drawback is unless you make a bunch of different ones you are stuck with one design.

anyways thx 4 the free pts fam."

"Orlando is most likely to focus on events that occurred between ages 10 and 30. The memory is divided into long and short-term memory. To learn it is necessary to pass information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Between 10 and 30 years is easier to perform this process is why in old age is more likely to remember situations that occurred decades ago to situations that occurred more recently.

I hope my answer can help you.

The Great Gatsby features extremely wealthy characters. Readers are given a look at the upper-upper class of the society. However, even in this social stratum, there is still a divide -- old money and new money. The old money people have had their wealth passed on from generation to generation, supposedly from rich European ancestors. New money folks worked hard to gain their wealth and did not come from rich families. In this regard, the proud old money look down on the new money since they do not really see them as part of the wealthiest.

After the Civil War, liberty was defined as the rights of all men to be treated equally under the law. The US government did their best to ensure that this happened, by implementing the 14th and 15th amendment. These amendments granted citizenship to any person born on US soil, guaranteed equal legal treatment under the Equal protection clause, and allowed black men the right to vote. These were all supposed to be positive steps towards creating a society in which ""liberty"" meant that all men had the same legal and political rights. 

However, this ideal world did not exist after the Civil War. The implementation of Jim Crow laws and ""separate but equal"" facilities created a society in the South which was based on unequal treatment of African-American citizens.

"Moon tides or lunar tides are caused
by the pull of gravity between the moon and earth. The moon will exert a
gravitational pull on earth and the earth also pulls the moon towards itself.
One of the results is that the moon is near the earth and the other one, the
oceans tide. Even though the earth can hold any object within ts proximity, the
ocean is partly attracted due to its liquid property. At night, the ocean tends
to be attracted to the moon by creating a bulge and assigning it as ‘high tide’.
This is due to the strong gravitational pull of th moon to the earth. The answer
is letter D."

"
"Marie Curie is mostly famous for her work in the field of radioactivity.

Answer: A. the field of radioactivity

Marie Curie was perhaps the most female scientist that ever lived. She made a huge leap in the science world. She discovered radium and polonium, and not just that, she inspired other young women that they can make a difference in the world. Back then, women could only be wives and mothers and teachers or tutors. They were not supposed to be scientists or professors. But, she did not let those ideas stop her. She made up her mind that she would be a scientist. She devoted her life to the study of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first person ever to win it twice. Her work on radioactivity helped scientists understand the world better. It helped doctors cure cancer. And it helped to change the way people thought about women. But Marie did not set out to change the world. She simply followed her dream --- to be the best scientist she could be.

In the 1960's when the separation of the church and state became a legal law. This affected religion in schools which in return affected the youth that was growing up during such times. Even though public schooling was meant for an all around education religion was once able to influence the body ( including students and teachers). But in the 70's religion became viewed as something that didn't deal with education and was instead something children should learn at home from parents or the church. This affected politics because politics and the governmental laws go hand in hand.

The correct answer is B.

Let us think of the classical theory first. In the classical theory, light is a wave that gives energy. This energy gradually helps the electron jump to a higher energy level.
In quantum theory, this is wrong; an electron cannot absorb a small amout of energy because there is not close enough state to jump to with that energy; only very specific amounts of energy lead to a change in orbital levels/ absorbance of energy. Also, each pair of energy levels has a specific energy difference that is needed from an electron so that it can move. 
Hence, B is correct; all other sentences describe classical models of light-electron interactions

The answer is 57.04 meters. 
Solution:
The height y of the rock above the ground as a function of the horizontal distance x from the starting point on top of the hill can be modeled by the equation 
     y = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

We now set this equation equal to zero because the height of the ground where the rock will land is zero:
     0 = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

Since we have a quadratic equation, we can calculate for the horizontal distance x by using the quadratic formula     
     x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a      
     x = {-1.3 ± sqrt[1.3^2 - 4(-0.04)(56)]} / 2(-0.04)     
     x = (-1.3 ± sqrt(10.65)) / (-0.08)     
     x =  -24.54 meters or  57.04 meters
There are two solutions for x but one is negative, so we choose the positive value.

I'm struggling with the wording of the second choice.

I have met people who do not agree with my assessment of the Universe, but they are in the minority and they are not fools for declining to agree. 

I am trying to say that Religion and Science can coexist and many people feel this coexistence to be true without question. People pray for example who also manipulate complex mathematical ideas. We don't choose conflict without reason, but coexistence is always possible. It only takes men and women of good will to make it work.

If you confront someone right off the bat since you think they are talking to someone who talks about you behind your back or they are dating your boyfriend or your boyfriend is dating someone else behind your back don't confront. Trick them into telling you what they are doing or follow them and catch them in the act so they have no chance in saying that they didn't do it. Confrontation can lead to them lying to you. Sometimes you might be wrong and when you confront them and find out that it really wasn't what they were doing, they get mad and decide that they are going to leave you or are not going to talk to you. Or maybe they decide that they are going to forget about it and then confront you with something and let you feel the hurt and pain that that brings to a person. It will lead to them wanting to have revenge on you or they will want to do those things on purpose and flaunt it in your face.

When Galileo got ahold of a little telescope ... no more than 
a kid's toy today ... he soon turned it towards the night sky.  
The story says that he was the first one to do that.  Apparently 
everyone else who had these things used them to look at their 
neighbors' windows.  Anyway, When Galileo looked at Jupiter, 
he saw four tiny dots.  As he watched them night after night, he 
saw that the four dots always stayed with Jupiter, but got nearer 
and farther from it.  He eventually realized that they were small 
bodies in orbit around Jupiter.  And then ... because he was Galileo ... 
he made the big intellectual jump:  He reasoned that if there were 
smaller bodies in orbit around Jupiter, then Jupiter and the other 
planets might also be in orbit around something, and not necessarily 
around the Earth.  He understood this as evidence that the sun is 
the center of the solar system.

Your set is 2, 5 and 8.

In order to calculate the standard deviation, first, you need to calculate the mean of the scores:
m = (2 + 5 + 8) / 3
    = 15 / 3
    = 5

Then, find the variance: subtract the mean from each value, square the results, sum them up and divide it by the number of scores.
(2 - 5)² = 9
(5 - 5)² = 0
(8 - 5)² = 9
Therefore:
v = (9 + 0 + 9) / 3 
   = 18 / 3
   = 6

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
σ = √6 
   = 2.45

In conclusion, the standard deviation can be calculated by the formula:

The Renaissance scholars were much interested in reviving the classical era of Greek and Roman culture.   These areas of culture were revived in the visual arts and in architecture.  The humanists of the Renaissance studied Greek and Roman writings, focused on the ""humanities"" such as philosophy and history.  (Today we also call such studies the ""liberal arts."")

The Renaissance happened across Europe, but was sparked by affluent city-states in Italy.  These city-states were wealthy from products they made and some became very rich through trade and commerce.  Wealthy persons in the Italian cities were sponsors of art and architecture and liberal studies, thus promoting the culture of the Renaissance.  Much of this wealth came from trading with the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire, so there was an indirect role of Muslims in the support of the Renaissance.  The Medici family were granted permission from the pope for exclusive rights to alum trade with the Ottomans, thus enriching and empowering the Medici.    When the Ottomans took over sections of the old Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantine scholars fled to Italy, which also spurred the Renaissance movement in Italy.  Another way Muslims were in the background of Renaissance thought was how Muslim scholarship in math and science filtered over into European scholarship.

John Green, in Crash Course, argues against the ""Renaissance"" as a thing because the art and learning was only experienced at the top of society.  The vast majority of Europeans still lived on farms and were not well educated.  Most Europeans didn't encounter the Renaissance's pattern of thought during that time.  We remember it because of the ideas that came from it that are important to us now.  The Renaissance is more of a construct we have made out of various things that happened over a span of centuries.

As to whether or not you agree with Green's argument, that's up to you.

The correct answer is C. they both sought equal rights for African Americans.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a federal law that bans work place discrimination. This means that a person cannot be stopped from obtaining a job based on their race, color, religion, gender, nation of origin, etc.

Evolution theory: This is purely based off the fact that we evolved to be bipedal; we walk on two legs, to see higher (a paramount evolutionary trait at the time). Had we just stuck to four, we would be faster. Greater stability is gifted to four-legged organisms. An advantage we DO have, however, is that we have the BEST running endurance in the animal kingdom.

Christianity: Adam and Eve were bipedal, so that's how we are.
"
"
Physiologically we're inadequately suited to sprinting, for the most part since we're bipedal. Creatures that can keep running on four legs are continually going to have the point of interest. There are two clarifications for this. The more ordinary one is basically that at no time in our development was running a critical adjustment for us. We went from tree-staying foragers to apparatus utilizing etc.

People aren't as quick in a sprint as some different creatures, yet we are among the best long-distance runners of all. It's a transformative exchange off; no one's body shape can be great at everything. Hunters like us additionally need to make a considerable measure of progress to chase and scavenge, so it bodes well that we are more suited to continuance running than sprinting.

The correct answer is high, low.

Arteries are part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying blood away from the heart and around the body. The arterial blood is oxygenated and this process ensures that every tissue around the body will receive oxygen and nutrients through this blood flow. 

Veins are also part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying the deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart. 

Venous pressure is much lower than the arterial pressure. More specifically, venous pressure ranges from 5 to 8 mmHg, while arterial pressure ranges from 15 to 30 mmHg.

Given that only the top 1% are admitted, the cutoff will be as follows:
the z-score is given  by:
z=(x-μ)/σ
where:
μ-mean
σ-standard deviation
P(x>X)=1-P(z<Z)=0.01
⇒P(z<Z)=1-0.01=0.99
thus:
the value of z that corresponds to 0.99 is 2.33
thus:
2.33=(x-600)/60
solving for x we get:
139.8=x-600
x=739.8
thus the cutoff was 739.8

The parts of the heart are the atria, ventricles, septum, valves. The atria collects oxygenated blood that has returned from the lungs.The ventricles , receive blood from the atria. The septum it separates the left atrium and ventricle from the right atrium and ventricle. Finally, the valves separate the various parts of the heart from one another. They allow blood into places it’s supposed to be and keep it out of places it’s not supposed to be.
Undoubtedly, there are more parts of the heart but these are the main functions.

Answer #1 is ""there is 2.5 grams of solute in every 100 g of solution."" 
We calculate for 2.5% by mass solution by dividing the mass of the solute by the mass of the solution and then multiply by 100.
Answer #2 is ""that mass ratio would be 2.5/100 or 2.5 grams of solute/100 grams of solution."" 
We weigh out 2.5 grams of solute and then add 97.5 grams of solvent to make a total of 100 gram solution, that is,
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g solute / (2.5g solute + 97.5g solvent)
                                                          = 2.5g solute / 100g solution
Answer#3 is ""a solution mass of 1 kg is 10 times greater than 100 g, thus one kilogram (1 kg) of a 2.5% ki solution would contain 25 grams of ki.""
We multiply 10 to each mass so that 100 grams becomes 1000grams since 1000 grams is equal to 1 kg:
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g*10/[(2.5g*10) + (97.5g*10)]
                                                          = 25g solute/(25g solute + 975g solvent)
                                                          = 25g solute/1000g solution
                                                          = 25g solute/1kg solution

The answer is Process 1 describes artificial selection and process 2 describes genetic engineering. Artifical selection involves the artificial breeding of two or more species and selecting the desired traits. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genetic material  of an organism of a species to achieve desired  characteristics.
 
Question 17;
The answer is Both characteristics represent meiosis. This is a type of cell cycle that occurs in the gonads of organisms in the process of formation of gametes. The gametes cells have half the genetic material as the pre-gamete cells/or   somatic cells. For example, humans cells, that are usually diploid, are halved in meiosis to make gamete cell haploid.   Meiosis I halve the genetic material while meiosis II is similar to mitosis that duplicates.
 
Question 18;
  R R r Rr Rr r Rr RrThe answer is 4 red : 0 white
This is because the question asks for phenotypic ratio which is the morphology.  As shown in the punnet square, all the offspring will be heterozygous for the color, but since Red is dominant over white, all the offspring will exhibit the red color.
 
Question 19;
The answer is Heat water and records its change in temperature with time. This relates to the first law of thermodynamics, which stipulates on the law of conservation of energy.  Therefore when energy is put into a system, the system is expected to do work (in this case is the increase in temperatures).

The answer is The pea plant received different alleles from both parents. During the fusion of gametes from male and female, the haploid cells of the gametes fuse to form a haploid zygote. This zygote has alleles from both parents on virtually all genes. The dominant allele shows in the phenotype.
Question 2;
The answer is 25%This is because cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic disorder will only show in the offspring if they are recessive for both alleles in the gene for cystic fibrosis. The offspring that are heterozygous for the disease will show no symptoms because the dominant alleles mask the effect of the recessive allele.
 
Question 3;
  Y y y Yy Yy y Yy yy 
 
According to the statement, Yellow color is dominant over the green, because in the heterozygous plant, the yellow color masks the green color. Therefore, based on the punnet square above, 50% of the offspring will be yellow (heterozygous) and the other 50% will be green (homozygous recessive).
 
 
Question 4;
Damage to marine flora and fauna due to oil spills could be prevented. In case of an oil spill, the genetically-engineered pseudomonas bacteria will be able to break down the oil particles and convert them to biomolecules. This will remove the oil before it does more harm to an ecosystem.
 
Question 5;
They have Furry feet. This is one of the adaptations of the polar bears have to ensure that they survive the harsh cold climate of the Arctic region. They also have wide feet to reduce the pressure on their weight on the ice and therefore good for movement on the ice, especially thin ice

Gabriela owns a company that makes silk scarves. She buys the silk from an overseas supplier and is subject to a tax on imported goods. Gabriela most likely lives in a mixed market economy with some government regulation.

A mixed economic system features characteristics of both capitalism and socialism. A mixed economic system protects private property and allows a level of economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims. According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets, but proponents of government interventions argue that the base conditions such as equal information and rational market participants cannot be achieved in practical application.

Part (a): Annual worthy analysis
Annual worthy = -Annuities  of PV (cost) - Annual expenses + Annuities of FV (salvage cost)

Then,
For GM model:
Annual worthy = -36,000(A|P,12%,3) -4000 + 15,000(A|F,12%,3)
Where,
(A|P,12%,3) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12}^-1 = 0.41635;
(A|F,12%,3) = {[(1+0.12)^3-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.29635
Therefore,
Annual worthy for GM model = -36,000(0.41635) - 4,000 + 15,000(0.29635) = -$50,543.35

For Ford model:
Annual worthy = -32,000(A|P,12%,4) - 4,100 + 15,000(A|F,12%,4)
Where,
(A|P,12%,4) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12}^-1 = 0.32923
(A|F,12%,2) = {[(1+0.12)^4-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.20923
Therefore,
Annual worthy of Ford model = -32,000(0.32923) - 4,100 + 15,000 (0.20923) = -$11,496.91

It can be noted that Annual worth of Ford > Annual worthy of GM model and thus the best option is the Ford model

Part (b): Present Worth (PW)
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(P/A,12%,3) + 15,000(P/F,12%,3)
Where
(P/A,12%,3) = [1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12 = 2.40183
(P/F,12%,3) = 1/(1+0.12)^3 = 0.71178
Therefore,
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(2.40183) + 15,000 (0.71178) = -$34,930.62

PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(P/A,12%,4) + 15,000(P/F,12%,4)
Where,
(P/A,12%,4) = [1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12 = 3.03735
(P/F,12%,4) = 1/(1+0.12)^4 = 0.63552
Therefore,
PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(3.03735) + 15,000 (0.63552) = -$10,014.065

Based on PW, PW of Ford model > PW for GM model and thus Ford model is the better option.

X= # hours first mechanic worked
y= # hours second mechanic worked

QUANTITY EQUATION 
x + y= 20 hours 

COST EQUATION 
$115x + $80y= $1775


STEP 1:
multiply both sides of cost equation by -115

-115(x + y)= -115(20)
-115x - 115y= -2300


STEP 2:
add quantity equation and equation from step 1 together to solve for y

115x + 80y= 1775
-115x - 115y= -2300
x will cancel out

-35y= -525
divide both sides by -35
y= 15 hours second mechanic worked


STEP 3:
substitute y value in quantity equation to solve for x

x + y= 20
x + 15= 20
subtract 15 from both sides
x= 5 hours first mechanic worked


ANSWER: The first mechanic worked 5 hours and the second mechanic worked 15 hours. 

Hope this helps! :)
