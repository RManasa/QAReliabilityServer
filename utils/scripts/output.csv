The lines from this excerpt that suggest that Mr. Darcy is questioning his hasty judgment and has fallen in love with Elizabeth are the following one: ""But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes."" This is the moment he realized that he was wrong about her and that there is more to her than he originally thought. He realized that he has already fallen in love with her, despite her flaws.

No slavery wasn't a choice... 

Many slaves were beaten if they rebelled or tried to get their own rights. Children were born into slavery meaning that that's all the knew. Most owners didn't teach their slaves to read or write, so slaves couldn't easily survive on their own because they weren't educated enough to get a job.

The civil war showed how slaves didn't have a choice or rights even though they desperately wanted them, and even after the war their was segregation. Slaves didn't have a choice or a voice.

The hummingbird's nutritional needs daily are 10,000 mg of sugar and 8,000 mg of protein. 

Since one nasturtium flower provides 10 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 1000 nasturtium flowers each day for its nutritional needs (10,000/10 = 1000). 
Since one honeysuckle flower provides 20 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 500 honeysuckle flowers each day for its nutritional needs. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on nasturtium flowers, then the bird will need 5,000 seconds to get exactly the food it needs. This is calculated based on the information that it takes 5 seconds to feed on a nasturtium: 1000 flowers daily * 5 seconds = 5000 sec = 83,3 min. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on honeysuckle flowers, then the bird will need: 500 flowers * 20 seconds = 10,000 sec = 166,6 min.

You can look at this problem step by step. 
First step: Probability that the first pick is male = 10/20   (as 10 males out of 20 people)
2nd step: Probability that the second pick is male= 9/19 (as there are 9 males left out of 19 people) 
3rd step: P = 8/18
4th step: P = 7/17

As these all need to happen once you need to multiply the probabilities. 

The result is: 10/20 * 9/19 * 8/18 * 7/17
You can simplify this if you wish.

Since it is geometric sequence, we know that a₄ = a₁ r³ and a₆ = a₁ r⁵

So we have a₆ / a₄ = a₁ r⁵ / a₁ r³ = r²

Also a₆ / a₄ = 64 / 16 = 4

So r would be either 2 or -2. Let's go with 2 for now.

Now let's find a₁.

a₄ / r = a₃ = 16 / 2 = 8

a₃ / r = a₂ = 8 / 2 = 4

a₂ / r = a₁ = 4 /2 = 2

So S₄ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30

So final answer: S₄ = 30

The correct answer is a response. 

According to the communication process theory, a response refers to the impact or call to action that occurs as a result of a being subject to a message such as a television advertisement. In this instance, the ad about Claritin had an impact on Ann, leading her to immediately go to to a pharmacy to purchase it.

Mean is the same thing as average
example
the mean of 30 and 40 is 35 because (30+40)/2=70/2=35

mean absolue deviation is when you take the mean of the set
then you find the diffference of each number of the set then take the mean of that
ex if yo uhave 1,2,3,4,5 and the mean is 3, then ou find the absolute value of the difference of each
|1-3|=2
|2-3|=1
|3-3|=0
|4-3|=1
|5-3|=2
add them and divide by 5
(2+1+0+1+2)/5=6/5= MAD=6/5

basically it tells how spread out the graph is or how close the points are to the mean
so the smaller mean average deviation, the closer the points are to the mean
the bigger it is, the farther they are

so if they had the points 1,2,3,4,5 and mean is 3 and MAD=6/5, 6/5 is small so therefor the points are close to that number
if I had the points 1,1,1,2,5,5 and the mean was 3 and MAD=11/5, 11/5 is bigger than 6/5 and therefor the points are more spread out


therefor the math scores are closer togeher
science is farther apart

if you mean that the highest grade in math was compared witht eh highest grade in science, then science is higher since the plots are more spread out

since math had a smaller MAD than science, the points are closer together

so the answers are C and D

Painted area= 

Now, to find rate, in square feet per hour, we are going to divide the painted area by the number of hours: 
Rate=

We can conclude that Kyler paints at a rate of 434.78 square feet per hour.

Let us go over every choice:
D) D is incorrect; Neanderthals were a hominid species and a relatively advanced one since they lived very closely in time to homo sapiens (modern man). Neanderthals used to live in Europe and had been living there before modern man came from Africa.
C) This is not precise. While it could have been used as a weapon, nowhere in the passage can we see a hint for that. It might have helped modern humans in other ways, making them more reliably survive cold periods and thus displacing the resident Neanderthals.
B) This is also not precise. While the passage implies that fire might have been an important factor for the migration, quite possibly there could be other important aspects of migration to learn. Also, the passage says ""may have helped"", it is not too definitive.
A) THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. The only concrete fact of the passage is the fact that Neandertals went extinct after the arrival of the modern man. The passage in whole is arguing that since fire is so important in Europe and the Neanderthals did not have access to it, we could attribute their extinction to the modern humans having fire as a competitive advantage.

Among these bills, you can pick up
the Social Security Act for sure. This particular one entails the minimum
amount of purchasing capacity that beneficiaries from this policy can take
advantage of (crucial government decision to set up the economic virtuous
circle). Moving on, you can also pick the Stock Market Security Act. Given the
financial mayhem taken place in Wall Street by the later 20’s, the U.S. corresponding
authorities effectively pulled off a better regulation of the stockbrocking
activity.
