A transgenic organism expresses DNA that has been derived from another species. These organisms have altered genomes and are generated in the laboratory for the purposes of research, for example, the \"knock-out\" mice are tansgenic mice with a particular gene of interest disabled.\u00a0\n2. Recombinant DNA is the DNA that has been altered to contain genes, or portions of genes, from different organisms. The DNA molecules are formed in the lab using recombination methods to bring together genetic material from multiple sources and therefore creating sequences that are not found in the genome.\u00a0\n3. Restriction enzymes are found naturally in bacteria and they cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. These enzymes are also called restriction endonucleases, they cleave DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites called restriction sites. They are found in bacteria and archaea and they serve to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses.\n4. Biotechnology is the use or alteration of organisms, cells, or biological molecules to produce food, drugs, or other goods. Living systems and organisms are used to make or develop products. Biotechnology enhances cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and product for the purposes of improving life and health.\u00a0\n5. Polymerase chain reaction is a technique that is used to quickly synthesize billions of copiies of a specific segment of DNA.\u00a0 It is a quick and a very efficient way to generate many copies of DNA.\u00a0 The process is applicable when there are small quantities of DNA to analyze. The events of PCR involves; separation of DNA strands, addition of primers, use of DNA polymerase to produce second strand of DNA.\u00a0\n6. In the process known as transformation, bacteria take up pieces of DNA from the surroundings. Bacterial transformation results from the uptake of naked DNA (DNA without associated cells or proteins). Transformation may also occur naturally in some species of bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "rating": 0, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 0, "num_thanks": 0}], "top_answer": {"question": "A expresses dna that has been derived from another species. 2. dna that has been altered to contain genes, or portions of genes, from different organisms is known as . 3. a , which is found naturally in bacteria, cuts dna at a specific nucleotide sequence. 4. is the use or alteration of organisms, cells, or biological molecules to produce food, drugs, or other goods. 5. is a technique used to quickly synthesize billions of copies of a specific segment of dna. 6. in a process known as , bacteria take up pieces of dna from their surroundings.", "subject": "Biology", "text": "\n1.
