So we know B isn't the answer because the destruction was widespread. And we know it wasn't D because the population changed a lot, by 250,000+ people. So that leaves us with A and C as possible answers. C is most unlikely the answer because to this day, the jobs are still very low and because of this, the money was very low. So I would think the answer is A.
