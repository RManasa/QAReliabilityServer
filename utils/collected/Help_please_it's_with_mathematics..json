Let's go with 2 for now.\n\nNow let's find a\u2081.\n\na\u2084 / r = a\u2083 = 16 / 2 = 8\n\na\u2083 / r = a\u2082 = 8 / 2 = 4\n\na\u2082 / r = a\u2081 = 4 /2 = 2\n\nSo S\u2084 = a\u2081 + a\u2082 + a\u2083 + a\u2084 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 =\u00a030\n\nSo final answer: S\u2084 = 30\n\nHope this helps.\n", "rating": 0, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 0, "num_thanks": 0}], "top_answer": {"question": "Help please it's with mathematics.", "subject": "Mathematics", "text": "\nWhat is the question\n", "rating": 0, "reputation": "Helping Hand", "num_upvotes": 0, "num_thanks": 0}}, "availability": {"url": "https://brainly.com", "archived_snapshots": {"closest": {"status": "200", "available": true, "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180624052629/https://brainly.com/", "timestamp": "20180624052629"}}}}
