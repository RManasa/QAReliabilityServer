        "question": "Read this excerpt from \"Talking Robots.\" \n\nOf course, neural networks still have a long way to go before they can model the human brain. As physicist Heinz Pagels has said: \u201cThe difference between a real neuron and the model neurons . . . is like the difference between a human hand and a pair of pliers.\u201d But the fact that a simple neural network can speak at all is remarkable, indicating that perhaps human abilities can be simulated by electronics. . . . \n\nWhich is the most accurate summary of Kaku\u2019s argument? \n\nA. The simulated speech of neural networks suggests the potential for other electronic simulations.\nB. Neural networks are vastly inferior to the human brain, and critics question whether they can speak at all. \nC. Neural networks are vastly different from the human brain, just as pliers are different from the human hand. \nD. Electronic simulation of speech suggests that technological ability will eventually exceed human potential.",
