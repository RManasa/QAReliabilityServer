Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 Northern states. The South claimed just 9 million people \u2014 including 3.5 million slaves \u2014 in Confederate states. Despite the North\u2019s greater population, however, the South had an army almost equal in size during the first year of the war.\n\nThe North had an enormous industrial advantage as well. At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. But that statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North manufactured 97 percent of the country\u2019s firearms, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes.
