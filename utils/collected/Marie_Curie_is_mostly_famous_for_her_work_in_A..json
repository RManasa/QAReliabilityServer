She made a huge leap in the science world. She discovered radium and polonium, and not just that, she inspired other young women that they can make a difference in the world. Back then, women could only be wives and mothers and teachers or tutors. They were not supposed to be scientists or professors. But, she did not let those ideas stop her. She made up her mind that she would be a scientist. She devoted her life to the study of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first person ever to win it twice. Her work on radioactivity helped scientists understand the world better. It helped doctors cure cancer. And it helped to change the way people thought about women. But Marie did not set out to change the world. She simply followed her dream --- to be the best scientist she could be.\n", "rating": 5, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 3, "num_thanks": 4}], "top_answer": {"question": "Marie Curie is mostly famous for her work in\nA. the field of radioactivity.\nB. the theory of evolution.\nC. the theory of relativity.\nD. the field of electromagnetism.", "subject": "History", "text": "\nMarie Curie is mostly famous for her work in \u00a0A. the field of radioactivity.She worked with her husband, Peirie Curie, and they both studied radioactive\u00a0elements.\u00a0\n", "rating": 4.9, "reputation": "Brainly User", "num_upvotes": 9, "num_thanks": 12}}, "availability": {"url": "https://brainly.com/question/868105", "archived_snapshots": {"closest": {"status": "200", "available": true, "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160104185528/http://brainly.com:80/question/868105", "timestamp": "20160104185528"}}}}
