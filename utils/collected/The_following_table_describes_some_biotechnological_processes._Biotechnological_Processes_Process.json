Artifical selection involves the artificial breeding of two or more species and selecting the desired traits. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genetic material\u00a0 of an organism of a species to achieve desired\u00a0 characteristics.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 17;\nThe answer is Both characteristics represent meiosis. This is a type of cell cycle that occurs in the gonads of organisms in the process of formation of gametes. The gametes cells have half the genetic material as the pre-gamete cells/or\u00a0 \u00a0somatic cells. For example, humans cells, that are usually diploid, are halved in meiosis to make gamete cell haploid.\u00a0 \u00a0Meiosis I halve the genetic material while meiosis II is similar to mitosis that duplicates.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 18;\n\u00a0 R R r Rr Rr r Rr RrThe answer is 4 red : 0 white\nThis is because the question asks for phenotypic ratio which is the morphology.\u00a0 As shown in the punnet square, all the offspring will be heterozygous for the color, but since Red is dominant over white, all the offspring will exhibit the red color.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 19;\nThe answer is Heat water and records its change in temperature with time. This relates to the first law of thermodynamics, which stipulates on the law of conservation of energy.\u00a0 Therefore when energy is put into a system, the system is expected to do work (in this case is the increase in temperatures).\n\u00a0\nQuestion 1;\nThe answer is The pea plant received different alleles from both parents. During the fusion of gametes from male and female, the haploid cells of the gametes fuse to form a haploid zygote. This zygote has alleles from both parents on virtually all genes. The dominant allele shows in the phenotype.\nQuestion 2;\nThe answer is 25%This is because cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic disorder will only show in the offspring if they are recessive for both alleles in the gene for cystic fibrosis. The offspring that are heterozygous for the disease will show no symptoms because the dominant alleles mask the effect of the recessive allele.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 3;\n\u00a0 Y y y Yy Yy y Yy yy\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAccording to the statement, Yellow color is dominant over the green, because in the heterozygous plant, the yellow color masks the green color. Therefore, based on the punnet square above, 50% of the offspring will be yellow (heterozygous) and the other 50% will be green (homozygous recessive).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQuestion 4;\nDamage to marine flora and fauna due to oil spills could be prevented. In case of an oil spill, the genetically-engineered pseudomonas bacteria will be able to break down the oil particles and convert them to biomolecules. This will remove the oil before it does more harm to an ecosystem.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 5;\nThey have Furry feet. This is one of the adaptations of the polar bears have to ensure that they survive the harsh cold climate of the Arctic region. They also have wide feet to reduce the pressure on their weight on the ice and therefore good for movement on the ice, especially thin ice\n", "rating": 5, "reputation": "Ambitious", "num_upvotes": 1, "num_thanks": 1}], "top_answer": {"question": "The following table describes some biotechnological processes. \n\nBiotechnological Processes Process Description 1 Cross-breeding high-yielding wheat variety with a disease-resistant wheat variety\n\n2 Inserting bacterial toxin production genes in cotton \n\nWhich biotechnological processes are described in the table? \nBoth processes describe cloning. \n\nBoth processes describe genetic engineering. \n\n(Process 1 describes artificial selection and process 2 describes cloning.)\n\nProcess 1 describes artificial selection and process 2 describes genetic engineering.\n\n\nQuestion 17(Multiple Choice Worth 3 points)\n\n(06.04 MC) \n\nThe characteristics of certain cell divisions are described in the following table.\n\nCell Division Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDescription\n1\nForms haploid cells\n2\nForms four daughter cells\n\n\nWhich type(s) of cell division do the two characteristics represent?\n\nBoth characteristics represent meiosis.\nBoth characteristics represent mitosis.\nCharacteristic 1 represents meiosis and characteristic 2 represents mitosis.\nCharacteristic 1 represents mitosis and characteristic 2 represents meiosis.\n\n\nQuestion 18(Multiple Choice Worth 3 points)\n\n(06.03 MC) \n\nThe trait for flower color in a plant has red and white alleles.
