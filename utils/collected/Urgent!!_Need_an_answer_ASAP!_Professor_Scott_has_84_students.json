In other words\nP(-1 < z < 1) = 0.68 approximately (see note below)\n\nMultiply 0.68 by the total 84 to get\n0.68*84 = 57.12\nwhich rounds to 57 people\n\nNote: we can use a calculator to get a more accurate result of 0.68268949; a data table works as well but it won't be as accurate. For the purposes of this problem, the value 0.68 is good enough\n\n", "rating": 5, "reputation": "Ace", "num_upvotes": 2, "num_thanks": 1}], "top_answer": {"question": "Urgent!!
