In Torri's experiment, she sets up two knobs in a cage with a mouse. When the mouse touches the knob on the left, it receives a small shock. When it touches the knob on the right, it receives a food reward. After several attempts, the mouse learns to only touch the knob on the right. Torri concludes that mice are capable of learning. In Tamara's experiment, she also sets up two knobs in a cage with a mouse. She constantly alternates which knob causes the mouse to get shocked, and which knob gives the mouse a food reward. The mouse does not ever learn to reliably touch one knob or the other. Tamara concludes that mice are incapable of learning.
