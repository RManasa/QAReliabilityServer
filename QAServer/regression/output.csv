"Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server or computer network (Reference 1). Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a target’s computer and can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software (Reference 2). The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer user—and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency, which is typically described as a software bug. Programs officially supplied by companies can be considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user. For example, Sony sold the Sony rootkit, which contained a Trojan horse embedded into CDs that silently installed and concealed itself on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying. It also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created vulnerabilities that were then exploited by unrelated malware (Reference 3). One strategy for protecting against malware is to prevent the malware software from gaining access to the target computer. For this reason, antivirus software, firewalls and other strategies are used to help protect against the introduction of malware, in addition to checking for the presence of malware and malicious activity and recovering from attacks (Reference 4).","237","1387","8","0","0","0","0","26.333333333333332","9","0","17.393248945147683","38","0","0.8158719841271078","6.241894184153388","-0.13333333333333333","0.37777777777777777"
"Yesterday, at their annual meeting, the American Medical Association decided to classify obesity as a disease. They hope this change will help doctors to better treat the complex condition and aid in the fight against type 2 diabetes and heart disease. While The New York Times reports that the AMA's decision has no legal authority, some medical professionals think the outcome will result in sweeping changes. Proponents of the decision say that this could help people get coverage for obesity treatments from their insurance companies, just as insurance companies provide coverage for other health conditions. Others worry that because the tool most commonly used to measure obesity, the BMI chart, is flawed, that recognizing obesity as a disease won't result in better treatment for patients. A small debate has already started in the health and medical community about this news, as well as on the SparkPeople Message Boards and members are divided. One member noted that while she thinks it's too early in our understanding of obesity to classify it as a disease, this change might help remove some of the stigma overweight people face and make it easier for them to seek help. Another member calls the decision ""ridiculous"" because she thinks people will use the designation as an excuse not to make lifestyle changes. While it's much too early to really know how this shift may affect insurance coverage for obesity treatments, it's nice to think that doctors might change their approach to dealing with obese patients. Instead of just telling them to lose weight or to simply eat less and exercise more (standard advice many people receive without any real support or resources to make it happen), maybe obese patients will receive better interventions and treatment plans that really work.","293","1530","6","0","0","1","0","29.3","10","0","17.05935153583618","23","0","0.598656337139023","5.502999682759671","0.09004702194357367","0.33804672339155095"

"I’m a vegetarian. I won’t say it’s for “moral” reasons, but I am one because I don’t want to participate in animal anguish and pain. (There are also some health benefits.) A couple of years ago I realized something. Animals bred for their meat often live lives of misery, punctuated by a final few minutes in the company of other animals being slaughtered. However, wild animals that are hunted for their meat live fairly normal lives up until the moment they’re killed, and that period of suffering is often very short. To me, it seems hunting animals is much more humane than farming them for their meat. Culling animals to control the population - for their benefit as a species or the benefit of other species that are at risk - is okay with me, as long as it’s done in as humane way as is practical. (In a perfect world, culling wouldn’t be needed, but we’re not living in a perfect world.) Poisoning and trapping aren’t humane. Hunting with a rifle is probably the most humane way to cull animals. Ideally, these animals would also be used for food - if not human food then at least pet food. I don’t know about the practicality of that, but it would be something to consider.","222","996","0","0","0","0","0","17.076923076923077","13","0","6.754677754677751","30","0","0.6330432564902398","4.673987962487605","0.20645933014354068","0.5100000000000001"
"I can handle this one. Aruba is my favorite place in the world. The weather is so predictable that they do not have weather forecasts. It will be low 80’s with a stiff breeze. Rainfall is brief showers most times. They are out of the hurricane zone so it is rare that a hurricane comes near. When I took the children and grandchildren on vacation there (10 of us in all), the amazing thing was at the end of the vacation, I asked each what their favorite part was. Each loved it and had something different that they loved: horseback riding along the ocean shore, snorkeling with the colorful fish, the pool sliding board, the great restaurants, the casino, the wonderful hot stone massage, the lazy river at the hotel, the butterfly farm, doing the jeep tour of the island (including the most romantic spot in the world) the natural pool where waves from the ocean come crashing over the rocks to fill the pool. There was pretty much full employment so there is no abject poverty as on some islands. The slogan of One Happy Island applies almost universally and the people are very friendly. Costs are also not as high as some islands. All types of vacation housing (in different price ranges) is available. The island is only 28 miles long so getting anywhere is not real difficult. One of the reason I do not like ocean cruises is that each place they dock is pretty much the same with the junk tourist shops and this is not an exception. Downtown has a fair amount of these but some are interesting. With the cruises, you do not have time to explore the rest of the island which is a shame. There is all kind of great restaurants there: seafood (of course) but French, German, Italian, Papiamento, Dutch, Brazilian, Argentinian steak houses, etc. All kinds of nightly entertainment for adults. Also a donkey farm, an ostrich farm, caves, off roading, the water sports, scuba, fishing, sunset cruises.","339","1571","3","0","0","3","0","17.842105263157894","19","0","8.498486259897533","52","0","0.44183275227903934","4.235440400297886","0.2809495464852607","0.5979761904761903"

"When Sydney Mesher tells people she's a dancer, they're often surprised, she says. The 20-year-old was born without a left hand, but that hasn't stopped her from pursuing her dreams in an industry known for its rigid body standards: ""I get to be that person that kind of breaks that barrier, of that mindset."" Mesher’s left arm ends at the base of her wrist due to symbrachydactyly, a rare condition that causes the underdevelopment of limbs in the womb. ""Growing up, I dealt with a lot of bullying, says the Portland, Ore., native. But she eventually recognized that the way people reacted to her was really all about them: What's happening is someone's acting out of their own fear."" Mesher is currently studying dance at Pace University in New York City. ""With dance you are constantly growing. There's no stopping point, she says. There's always a place to be better."" After college, she hopes to become a Rockette or a backup dancer for Lady Gaga. “I’m very grateful that I’m at a time in this industry where we’re starting to accept different body types, she says. I know I am different. Especially as an artist, it's so important to have those differences.” Her individuality shines through her work: ""This is part of who I am. It’s not who I am, but it’s part of me.

"The recent fires in Napa Valley and Sonoma, California present numerous issues for homeowners and business owners alike when it comes to navigating insurance claims. Questions arise as to what coverages are provided under a given insurance policy, how determinations on what is owed are made, what are the options on rebuilding, loss of income or extra expenses, coverage for damaged vines and wine, business interruption, and additional living expenses. This last topic was recently covered in a blog post by Denise Sze entitled, California Wildfires Bring the Need for Additional Living Expense Payments of Insurance Proceeds. The issues facing wineries affected by the recent fires are complex. From coverage issues related to crop insurance, building damage, loss of business income, and loss of business personal property, Merlin Law Group and Levin Simes have teamed up and are offering a free Information Meeting on Monday, November 13, 2017 from 2:00-4:00p.m. at V. Sattui Winery in St. Helena, California, to answer questions wineries may have regarding their insurance claims. We will be joined by Anita Oberholster, Ph.D, who will be discussing the impact of the recent fires and smoke damage on grapes and wine qualities, and insurance brokers Blake Longo and Mike Applegate to discuss specific insurance issues. Russell Kranzler, CPA, will also address issues related to business interruption. If you are a winery or business impacted by the recent fires, we invite you to attend.","240","1265","8","0","0","6","0","18.46153846153846","13","0","11.762894230769227","36","0","0.7097864995639099","5.761640130374159","0.006666666666666669","0.28944444444444445"

"Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ( listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician, demagogue,[1] and Pan-German revolutionary,[2][3]who was the leader of the Nazi Party(Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Führer (Leader"") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.[a] As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. This led to former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuading President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-partydictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.","255","1419","7","0","0","2","0","36.42857142857143","7","0","20.260403361344537","43","1","0.7621400520468967","6.991034860876353","0.21048951048951053","0.3894522144522145"
"Hitler sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people in Eastern Europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.","174","852","2","0","0","0","0","21.75","8","0","11.18137931034483","19","0","0.346715604035974","4.16106191567291","0.026282051282051282","0.2570512820512821"

"Yes, Mobile phone signals do get affected due to bad weather conditions. Our cell phone system uses Electromagnetic VHF waves for mobile and RF for broadcast at times for services like DTH etc. Now, when these wireless channel encounters the bad weather then following are some parameters that can cause problems in reception of a call, Dense cloud, thunder &lightning, temperature, humidity etc.
These factors actually cause what we call propagation delay effect i.e. to redirect or reflect,refract the signal in a direction which is not desired this is something like taking a DETOUR here its taken by the information signal, thus reaching us with some delay , having some noise. Above all these they tend to lose their signal strength and at times it reduces to a no signal, hence, affecting the normal procedure of call.
Another example is for those who uses DTH services where on a rainy day you see a message on the screen that says Problem in receiving signal due to bad weather conditions and heavy clouds"" something like this, this is nothing but Propagation delay and signal loss.","185","935","0","0","0","4","0","23.125","8","0","12.664121621621625","20","0","0.48285177172358457","4.635851601680252","-0.24","0.41999999999999993"

"Yes. The US Supreme court has pretty well outlined the limitations in the US; see the 200 or so cases listed in the first source. In the rest of the world there are different, usually more repressive, laws. Canada's recently passed bill C-16 has brought this issue to the surface. See the second source for a (rare) favorable view of the law. It points out that existing law still criminalizes ...extreme forms of speech – explicitly and extreme forms of homophobic, anti-Semitic or racist speech."" In the US even the existing law would not pass muster. Should it? The recent clampdowns in Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube remind us the freedom of speech we enjoy is really only guaranteed when the government's ox is gored. In America anybody, citizen or not, is allowed to protest openly any governmental policy or action. There are no sacred cows. However, in private forums like Facebook the owner of the forum has complete control of the content.

"The 23-year-old graduate student from Paris is researching the commercial use of personal information in the age of big data and she’s reached a controversial conclusion: If people really do own their data, then they should be allowed to sell it. Alice Logier
Source: Agence Lagraphy
Regulators from Brussels to Beijing are trying to curb the use of personal information and many Facebook users have been reviewing their privacy settings in recent weeks in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Liogier argues that entrepreneurs, officials and executives who want to get to grips with the next phase of the big data era need to look further.
It’s not about privacy, she says, it’s about ownership and control.

“The debate right now is focused on data protection and privacy -- that’s where fears have crystallized,” Liogier says. “But selling data and data ownership is the next big topic, and probably the most important topic.”
Consumers around the world are waking up to the fact that Facebook and Google’s online empires are built on data they signed away without any monetary compensation. The next step will be thinking about the alternatives, argues Liogier, who defended her masters thesis at Sciences Po in Paris last month and will start a management consulting job after the summer.","229","1177","8","0","0","3","0","28.625","8","0","15.77433406113537","21","0","0.5138062519041285","4.6608839788075365","0.17556390977443606","0.3527568922305764"

"Kofi Atta Annan [1] 8 April 1938 – 18 August 2018) was a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize.[2] He was the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders, an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela.[3] Born in Kumasi, in then British Gold Coast, Annan went on to study economics at Macalester College, international relations from the Graduate Institute Geneva and management at MIT. Annan joined the UN in 1962, working for the World Health Organization's Geneva office. He went on to work in several capacities at the UN Headquarters including serving as the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping between March 1992 and December 1996. He was appointed as the Secretary-General on 13 December 1996 by the Security Council, and later confirmed by the General Assembly, making him the first office holder to be elected from the UN staff itself. He was re-elected for a second term in 2001, and was succeeded as Secretary-General by Ban Ki-moon on 1 January 2007.
As the Secretary-General, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy; worked to combat HIV, especially in Africa; and launched the UN Global Compact. He was criticized for not expanding the Security Council and faced calls for resignation after an investigation into the Oil-for-Food Programme, but was largely exonerated of personal corruption.[4] After the end of his term as UN Secretary-General, he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to work on international development. In 2012, Annan was the UN–Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria, to help find a resolution to the ongoing conflict there.[5][6] Annan quit after becoming frustrated with the UN's lack of progress with regard to conflict resolution.[7][8] In September 2016, Annan was appointed to lead a UN commission to investigate the Rohingya crisis.[9]","337","1787","29","0","0","1","0","22.466666666666665","15","0","12.388971315529183","64","0","1.130743566850903","9.161414807946185","0.05142857142857144","0.25666666666666665"

The tires pick up everything on the road and I feel every bump too. I promise, I don't do donuts in the streets or over use the vehicle much. Basically to and from work and still have flats on all four tires. Air leaks on both front tires, I caught a screw on the back tire and grim that was wedged in the back tire to cause air leakage that had to be patched too. As I was told on my last visit. Even though I keep not only my vehicle and my tires immaculate, grime was a cause for air leaks. Out of all the vehicles I've ever owned, I never, ever had this many issues with tires since my purchase back in April at STS. I don't feel safe on the roads at all with these tires.

"China has the most modern ghost cities. Because investment vehicles are limited for the banks and citizens, money has been recirculated into development. Up till now, the system has worked well because China was a developing country. But now that China is, in many ways, developed this policy no longer works for managing its investments. This is also why Chinese construction firms are so aggressive in getting overseas construction contracts. 
Right now though, this highlights a problem with China's development policies, it has reached the end of the line and can't go further. 
Just as the US issued more debt until it became so low quality that it led to serious structural problems, the same is true for China's development policies. They have gone as far as they can, and can go no further.

"U.S. stocks rose, sending the S&P 500 Index past its January record, as an expanding economy and surging earnings erased a six-month drought in which equities tumbled into a correction. The dollar dropped. Equities capped a second straight week of gains and the dollar slumped Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank has no intention of raising interest rates at a faster pace. The latest stocks record marks another milestone in a nine-year bull run that’s now the longest in history. The dollar fell for the sixth time in seven days as Powell said that gradual rate increases are likely appropriate if growth stays strong, and “there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating.” The 10-year Treasury yield edged lower to 2.82 percent. Crude settled above $68 a barrel in New York and gold jumped above $1,200 an ounce. “It looks like he understands the light touch he has to have on raising rates versus inflation,” Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh, said by phone. “It doesn’t sound like he’s going to do a Greenspan, over-tighten. But he does understand inflation is now probably his primary objective, keeping that measure as the primary issue in the economy. But you also don’t want to kill the recovery and kill strong growth. He’s going to let the data decide.”

The Chinese yuan traded offshore surged against the greenback after the People’s Bank of China said it tweaked how it fixes the level of its nation’s currency. The government also said Friday it was removing limits on foreign ownership of its banks. The changes come after low-level talks between the U.S. and China this week failed to make any progress in ending the trade war as both side slapped new tariffs on each other. Investors hoping for a global-trade resolution were left disappointed after the U.S. talks with China ended with an increased likelihood that tit-for-tat tariffs will escalate, casting a shadow over the global-growth outlook. But the focus has shifted back to Fed policy, with bond traders now more certain of two rate hikes by year-end. However, this view could be tested with the turmoil in emerging markets, continuing trade tensions and political drama in Washington still hanging in the background.
Elsewhere, the Mexican peso pared gains against the greenback as cracks emerged in Nafta negotiations. Oil headed for the first weekly rise in two months amid prospects of tightening supplies from the North Sea to the Middle East.

"Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrɑːndeɪ/;[1] born June 26, 1993)[2] is an American singer and actress. She began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical 13, before playing the role of Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and in the spinoff Sam & Cat (2013–2014). She has also appeared in other theatre and television roles and has lent her voice to animated television and films. Grande's music career began in 2011 with the soundtrack Music from Victorious. In 2013, she released her first studio album Yours Truly, which entered atop the US Billboard 200. The album's lead single, The Way"", debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, with critics comparing her wide vocal range to that of Mariah Carey.","130","694","10","0","0","0","0","21.666666666666668","6","0","10.670794871794875","25","0","0.4317824164255378","4.778098169278731","0.10051020408163266","0.3818027210884353"

He inspected the power source but then noticed there was no string on the fan and asked if we had a remote. My son said we did and dug it out and pressed the button and it worked! Ha! He gave us a fair estimate to hang another dining room fan and sent along the estimate that evening. My husband realized he had a friend to hang the light for us instead, but we will definitely consider using First Class again for electric needs in the near future. Jonas also waived a fee to diagnose the electrical issue since we did not discuss any pricing upfront-he didn't charge us.

It depends on the job but I'd say that you are no longer at the entry level after two years. A college degree certainly plays a role.

"The Galaxy Note 9 is now officially on sale. You can buy it at Samsung's website, and local carrier stores and retailers. I picked up the Galaxy Note 9, popped out the S Pen stylus and started to write on the black screen in tart lemon-colored digital ink. It hit me: This phone is more fun to use than your phone. When I'm using the Note 9, I feel more inspired to write, draw, take precise screenshots using the tool, snap selfies with the S Pen's remote shutter, and playfully annotate photos to send to friends. But the Note 9 is no mere toy. It's also powerful as hell, with a 6.4-inch screen, 4,000-mAh battery, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and either 128GB or a whopping 512GB (!!!) of onboard storage, plus a microSD card if you want more, more, more.

"Atal Bihari Vajpayee BR (pronunciation [əʈəl bɪhaːɾiː ʋaːdʒpai]; 25 December 1924[1] – 16 August 2018[2]) was an Indian politician who served three terms as the Prime Minister of India: first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, and finally, for a full term from 1999 to 2004. A member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he was the first Indian prime minister who was not a member of the Indian National Congress party to have served a full five-year term in office. He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over four decades, having been elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, ten times, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament for Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh until 2009 when he retired from active politics due to health concerns. Vajpayee was among the founding members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), of which he was the president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. The erstwhile members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee as its first president.
During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engaging with President Pervez Musharraf, inviting him to India for a summit at Agra.
He was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee in 2015.[3] The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as Good Governance Day.[4][5] He died on 16 August 2018 due to age-related illness.[6]","356","1782","29","0","0","3","0","22.25","16","0","10.969382022471912","62","0","1.0419169449915644","8.471935092320171","0.11535087719298244","0.39078947368421046"
"Glad to support local biz. Mike responded very quickly and literally was at my home the next early morning to fix the issue with air furnace. Issue was quickly fixed, literally within one hour.
He sent me an electronic invoice with a brief description of work and few observations and quote for recommended future work.
Things I didn't like as much: The $99 fee for inspection DID NOT go toward repair (no parts were needed), instead, I was charged an additional hourly fee. With many service professionals it is customary to guarantee a minimum fee for a visit, but typically that fee would cover some of the labor. Not here.
Second: Inside the furnace, part was observed to be leaking and causing a minor surface rust. a Quote was provided for almost $400.
Ok, I called the owner and been told it's 30mins to one hour tops job. Trying to further get to bottom of what I instinctively felt like a high price, been told the part is a special order and a warranty would be provided. I said fine let me think about it. I come home, open the furnace cover and he's right - there are minor leak and some surface rust, but what clearly leaking is 14 years old dried out rubber gasket, which he wanted to charge me over $300 for. Ok, so let's say, that these magical gaskets aren't sold without the part. How much is a typical price for the kit: $40-$100 tops. Depends on furnace model. Again, a far cry from $300
Thanks, but no thanks.
P.S: I get that it's a business and he needs to make a living, but I hate the approach of cutting labor cost by lying about parts costs. I am ok with paying him fairly for the commute, expertise, and labor but let's not get to dishonest practices. This is 2018 and all it takes is a few mins to google the part and its cost.

"Maybe this question needs to be qualified with a country or location? Here in China Burger King is both marketed and presented as a 'premium' Western food chain, the healthy, expensive, up-market version of McDonalds. That is, it's twice the price of McDonalds and uses far better quality, fresher ingredients. The buns are wholemeal and are scattered with various oats and seeds. The salad is fresh, crunchy, and plentiful. The meat has that chargrilled flavour and also tastes of meat (notably Burger King wasn't involved in one of the many food scandals a couple of years ago that highlighted the use of well-past-its-use-by-date meat by KFC and McDonalds. Burgers and fries are offered with an assortment of different condiments (you only get 1 packet of ketchup per order in McDonald's, unless you specifically ask for more, in which case you'll get 2... no matter how much you've ordered). Even the packaging is better quality and, get this, you get cutlery with your meal(albeit plastic)! Whereas you might find a 24-hour McDonald's on an average street corner, you'll only ever find Burger King operating office hours inside a fancy shopping mall. It's been about 20 years since I've tried either chain in another country, and of course neither is anywhere near the same league as In-n-out, but here in China I would eat a Whopper over a Big Mac every time.","240","1146","13","0","0","1","0","21.818181818181817","11","0","10.96846590909091","41","0","0.3894647667617233","4.53915916863573","0.1605263157894737","0.5013157894736843"

"My institution does not monitor student attendance. That is my job. However, we have adopted Blackboard as our Course-Management System of choice across campus, and the student roster in Blackboard is updated every day by the Registrar's Office. We additionally have access to up-to-date course rosters through our implementation of the PeopleSoft productivity software. Presumably, the Registrar's office at your institution keeps up-to-date rosters and should be willing to share them with instructors. Otherwise, what's the point of having them? There are two methods I use to enforce / verify attendance in a large lecture course, and both require comparison of my data with the roster in Blackboard or PeopleSoft. I could write a short program to sort through both files for matches, but I would rather do it manually to help me remember students' names.
Quizzes - I give short (and simple) quizzes randomly, but at least once a week. Fully half of the points on the quizzes are for showing up and putting your name on the quiz. For this reason, quizzes cannot be made up for any reason, but I will drop three or four of the lowest quiz grades. Since the quizzes aren't hard and the quiz average counts for at least 10% of their final grade, students want to be there for the quiz. I like this method because it allows me to do random point assessments of different topics and to start associating student names with performance. The grading is not unbearable, since i write quizzes that are simple enough to be graded at a rate of 10 seconds per student.Clickers - If you use clickers, make each student buy their own clicker (About $40 US these days). At the beginning of class, they have to register their clicker with your software, which records the clicker's ID number. If you have a list matching clicker IDs to student names, then you take attendance every day automatically. It is easy to cheat this system, since a student can also bring their friend's clicker and sign-in for their friend also.","348","1698","10","0","0","0","0","19.333333333333332","18","0","10.135459770114942","46","0","0.5763252213831123","5.018083955419854","-0.03400297619047619","0.5506696428571428"

"Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926)[a] is Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. Elizabeth was born in London as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Andrew, Duke of York; and Edward, Earl of Wessex.
When her father died in February 1952, she became Head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. She has reigned through major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch as well as the world's longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state, the oldest and longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state.
Elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales. However, support for the monarchy remains high, as does her personal popularity.","363","2048","3","0","0","2","0","25.928571428571427","14","0","15.35676505312869","70","0","0.706673956858147","6.904017146079095","0.09168876262626263","0.2817171717171717"

"Three Basics of Productivity Use these principles to help guide you through your workday.
All workers and workdays are unique. With fewer companies and employees adhering to a traditional 9-to-5 day, the differences in our workdays are becoming more pronounced. But putting those differences aside, three overarching ideas apply to all our productivity tips:
1. Trust the small increments. You can’t expect to change years of working habits overnight. Small changes in how you work can gradually add up to big changes in productivity. Try one tip to start, and keep adding more as you find the strategies that work best for you.
2. Be accountable. Whether it’s weekly check-ins with a co-worker or setting your own deadlines and announcing them to others, having to answer to someone else can often force you to get the job done.
3. Forgive yourself. You are human: Accept that you are sometimes going to slip up, become distracted and have a bad day. It’s more important to move on than to dwell on your mistakes.","179","857","5","0","0","1","0","11.933333333333334","15","0","5.955325884543761","24","0","0.21905356606268464","3.4170341230229915","0.22321428571428575","0.5761904761904761"
"The Pentonie surname is derived from the English parish of Pentney, in Norfolk, near Swaffham. The place-name Pentney is thought to be derived from the Old English words ""pent"" meaning ""enclosure"" and ""eye"" meaning ""island."" The surname Pentonie was first found in Norfolk at Pentney, a village and civil parish about 8 miles (13 km) south-east of Kings Lynn that dates back to at least the 3rd or 4th centuries as evidence of a Romano-British local pottery industry was discovered and an ancient Roman road has been found running close to the settlement.","96","463","7","0","0","0","0","32.0","3","0","16.353749999999998","11","0","0.5226951993213744","4.342667337263892","0.01666666666666667","0.14814814814814817"

"Millennials, also known as Generation Y or Gen Y, are the generational demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the ""baby boom echo"" was generally less pronounced than the post–World War II baby boom. Although Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the generation is generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.[1] In most parts of the world, their upbringing was marked by an increase in a liberal approach to politics and economics; the effects of this environment are disputed. The Great Recession has had a major impact on this generation because it has caused historically high levels of unemployment among young people, and has led to speculation about possible long-term economic and social damage to this generation.","218","1189","5","0","0","1","0","31.142857142857142","7","0","18.447621231979028","25","0","0.48819382330579336","4.956839353267379","0.08305555555555556","0.38187499999999996"

He’s not in it.” We also got the excuse of the Belmar Residence have been complaining. Left and walked down the boardwalk and still dozens on dozens of pop up tents were all over the beach.

"Aretha Louise Franklin (March 25, 1942 – August 16, 2018) was an American singer, songwriter, and pianist.[1] She began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan where her father C. L. Franklin was minister. She embarked on a secular career in 1960 at age 18, recording for Columbia Records but achieving only modest success. She achieved commercial success and acclaim after signing to Atlantic Records in 1966, with songs such as ""Respect"", ""Chain of Fools"", ""Think"", ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"", and ""I Say a Little Prayer"". By the end of the 1960s, she was being called ""The Queen of Soul"". She recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Lady Soul (1968), Spirit in the Dark (1970), Young, Gifted and Black (1972), Amazing Grace (1972), and Sparkle (1976) before experiencing problems with her record company. She left Atlantic in 1979 and signed with Arista Records, finding success with the albums Jump to It(1982) and Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985) and with her part in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. She received international acclaim for singing the opera aria ""Nessun dorma"" at the Grammy Awards of 1998, replacing Luciano Pavarotti.

"Every time I see Deafheaven, the band has seemingly achieved another level of excellence. This is easily my fifth time seeing the Bay Area band and again they outdid themselves–incorporating a softer, even more warm performance style to go with their equally soft, welcoming black metal sound of Ordinary Corrupt Human Love. This is perhaps best evidenced by vocalist George Clarke’s lace fingerless gloves. When I first saw them open for Russian Circles after the release of Roads to Judah, Clarke had stiff, militaristic movements and tight black leather gloves to accentuate this jerkiness to his motion. As the years have passed and Deafheaven’s sound has softened, so too has Clarke’s mobility, bringing in a prowling sensuousness that is at once dangerous and vulnerable. Backed by the nigh-alien Drab Majesty, Deafheaven ruled the night. ","139","727","0","0","0","1","0","19.857142857142858","7","0","11.94691675231244","15","0","0.15415067982725836","3.4371655174590394","0.058270676691729306","0.4720551378446115"

"A Nightmare on Elm Street is an American horror franchise that consists of nine slasher films, a television series, novels, and comic books. The franchise began with the film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) created by Wes Craven. The franchise revolves around the fictional character Freddy Krueger, a former child killer who after being burned alive by the vengeful parents of his victims, returns from the grave to terrorize and kill the teenage residents of Springwood, Ohio in their dreams. The original film was written and directed by Craven, who returned to co-script the second sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), and to write and direct New Nightmare (1994). The films collectively grossed over $457 million at the box-office worldwide. The original film was released in 1984. A series of sequels produced by the independent film company New Line Cinema followed. New Line often attributes the growth of their company to the success of the Nightmare franchise.[Ref1]The film series as a whole has received mixed reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office. When comparing the United States box office grosses of other American horror film series, A Nightmare on Elm Street is the second highest grossing franchise in adjusted US dollars.[Ref2] In 1988, a television series was produced with Freddy as the host. The pilot episode focused on the night Freddy was burned alive by the angry parents of the children he had killed, though the rest of the series featured episodes with independent plots. Twelve novels, separate from the adaptations of the films, and multiple comic book series were published featuring Freddy Krueger, as well as a crossover filmfeaturing fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise. A Remake of the 1984 film was released in 2010, and a second remake is currently being planned.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref5]","318","1673","7","0","0","3","0","21.2","15","0","12.127547169811322","49","0","0.7375989431307791","6.65912373950946","0.06792929292929292","0.2810606060606061"
"In the pursuit of academic success, children sometimes need a break from the classroom and an opportunity to release pent-up energy. While academic success is no small feat, students who participate in at least one extracurricular physical activity are proven to reap more benefits than those who do not exercise regularly.Engaging in sports activities each week helps improve students’ focus on school work, as well as help them lead happier, healthier lives. Here are four reasons why students should be involved in structured, after-school physical activities.Academic Performance – Studies show that students involved in athletic programs maintain a higher GPA and achieve higher test scores. SPARKpe.org provides a list of recent studies proving the correlation between academic success and physical fitness.Fitness Habits – Sports help students develop coordination and teaches them how to care for their bodies through proper stretching and the development of fundamental mechanics. Participating in athletics at an early age instills physical fitness habits that carry over into adulthood, helping to avoid health problems.Mental and Emotional Benefits – Athletics have great physical benefits, but also help children to improve mentally and emotionally. While the body exercises, the brain releases endorphines. From a biological standpoint alone, students who are physically active are happier and have a constructive outlet through which to relieve stress.Development of Specific Skills – Through athletics, students are able to accumulate a whole host of skills and abilities. Leadership, teamwork, confidence, and self-reliance are the big character focuses. Critical thinking is developed on the playing field as athletes need to quickly solve problems created by their opponents. Time management, a skill necessary in adulthood, is also brought into play as children learn to balance their time between schoolwork, sports, and family life.","292","1692","2","0","0","5","0","18.25","16","0","13.93873287671233","36","0","0.5019465421248606","5.150572241187017","0.11015625000000001","0.3238839285714286"

"I can think of three specific cases where genre conventions can be an important part of the writing process: You are writing a formulaic book, where the familiarity of it is the core of the appeal. It might not be a book that you or I might want to read or write, but well-written formulaic books have a stable core audience that craves the specific, reliable pleasures of that particular genre.You are writing a book that reinterprets, reimagines or remixes a genre. It's a fairy tale in space (Star Wars). Or a detective noir in cyberspace (Neuromancer). Or a teen mystery at a magical boarding school (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). Whatever it is, it helps to really know the conventions of the genre you're tweaking before you tweak it.You are writing a book that subverts, questions, interrogates or deconstructs a genre. And you can't do that unless you know what the genre conventions are. Whether you're writing Don Quixote (a deconstruction of medieval romances) or The Hero and the Crown (a feminist revision of epic fantasy), you need to know your source material really well. In the end, however, the main reason to know genre conventions is this. It's easier to avoid cliches if you know what they are. It's often the people who are least familiar with genres that write the books that are the most like every single thing that came before. (Also worth noting: the books/movies cited above don't lack for popularity, critical acclaim, and influence).","256","1236","8","0","0","5","0","18.285714285714285","14","0","9.459810267857144","39","0","0.7132147436107544","5.2076762406467525","0.1268452380952381","0.316547619047619"
