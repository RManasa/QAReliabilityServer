By Sunday do you mean tomorrow or the coming weekend? 1000 will take some time and I wouldn't be able to have it by tomorrow, but I can try for next weekend.

Regarding the scripts, I was able to add the necessary dependencies and run them. I just need the bad_words.txt file (had to create a dummy one just to check if everything runs properly), and I had to add a bug fix in FormatQuestions. Were there any scripts to test other than those 3 (Run_Code, FormatQuestions, and CalculateFeatures)?

Best,
Shoumyo

Ok. Can you send it to me by next Friday or Saturday? Why does it take so much time? We already have like 200 instances which you grabbed earlier, so 800 more. What is the process of grabbing the data?

I will send you the bad_words.text file. No more scripts, did you install the packages etc. and see if the output is coming out fine?

Yea the output from the scripts seemed to be coming out fine. Collecting the data took time because I was doing it manually, and I believe I had collected 100 data points unless I forgot about doing a second batch. I also won't be free all of tomorrow so I'll get time on the weekdays. I'll automate the process further so that we can collect a lot more data (several thousand samples) if it's needed later on.

Best,
Shoumyo

Sure, I'll probably have to go back to manually remove the MC questions, single-worded answers can be removed pretty easily.

to Manasa 
Yes, 6:30 pm should be alright. Regarding the data collection, it's coming along quite well. The automation works pretty well and just needs to be given a list of keywords to search. It collected 920 questions in ~2.5 hours, which would've taken me 9-10 hours to do manually (since questions often have 2+ answers we easily have over 1000 samples). I just have to convert the JSON files into a large CSV file, which I already have a script for doing.
