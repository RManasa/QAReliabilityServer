Which best describes an observation and hypothesis that could lead to new experimentation? Dr. Cooper invents a machine that allows him to see atoms inside of matter with more detail. While studying an atom, he thinks he starts to see a pattern in its movement even though current theory states that atoms move in random motion. Dr. Gupta is studying electron attraction by watching how two electrons are drawn towards each other by gravity. He then finds that they push away from each other when they both have a negative charge. Dr. Snyder finished her investigation on particle physics. She concludes that there are eighteen types of elementary particles. Dr. Abdallah is writing a paper on the theory of evolution. To do so, she interviews several evolutionary scientists.", "subject": "History", "date": "1524871292", "all_answers": [{"question": "Observations can lead to hypotheses that can lead to new experimentation.
