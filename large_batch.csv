Where t1/2 is the half life of the element and λ is decay constant.

32 = 0.693 / λ 
λ   = 0.693 / 32          (1) 

Nt = Nο eΛ(-λt)          (2)

Where Nt is atoms at t time, λ is decay constant and t is the time taken.
t = 1.9 hours = 1.9 x 60 min

From (1) and (2),


Nt = Nο e⁻Λ(0.693/32)*1.9*60

A hummingbird needs 10 grams of sugar and 8 grams of protein each day. one honeysuckle flower provides 20 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein. one nasturtium flower provides 10 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein. it takes 5 seconds to feed from a nasturtium and 20 seconds per honeysuckle. how many minutes does it take to get exactly the food it needs?,Biology,"
The hummingbird's nutritional needs daily are 10,000 mg of sugar and 8,000 mg of protein. 

Since one nasturtium flower provides 10 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 1000 nasturtium flowers each day for its nutritional needs (10,000/10 = 1000). 
Since one honeysuckle flower provides 20 mg of sugar and 10 mg of protein, the hummingbird needs 500 honeysuckle flowers each day for its nutritional needs. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on nasturtium flowers, then the bird will need 5,000 seconds to get exactly the food it needs. This is calculated based on the information that it takes 5 seconds to feed on a nasturtium: 1000 flowers daily * 5 seconds = 5000 sec = 83,3 min. 
If the hummingbird feeds only on honeysuckle flowers, then the bird will need: 500 flowers * 20 seconds = 10,000 sec = 166,6 min.

Since it is geometric sequence, we know that a₄ = a₁ r³ and a₆ = a₁ r⁵

So we have a₆ / a₄ = a₁ r⁵ / a₁ r³ = r²

Also a₆ / a₄ = 64 / 16 = 4

So r would be either 2 or -2. Let's go with 2 for now.

Now let's find a₁.

a₄ / r = a₃ = 16 / 2 = 8

a₃ / r = a₂ = 8 / 2 = 4

a₂ / r = a₁ = 4 /2 = 2

So S₄ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30

So final answer: S₄ = 30

B. The grades of the students in science are a lot closer to 85 than the grades of the students in math.
C. The grades of the students in math are a lot closer to 85 than the grades of the students in science. 
D. The students scored lower grades in math than in science. 
",Mathematics,"
Mean is the same thing as average
example
the mean of 30 and 40 is 35 because (30+40)/2=70/2=35

mean absolue deviation is when you take the mean of the set
then you find the diffference of each number of the set then take the mean of that
ex if yo uhave 1,2,3,4,5 and the mean is 3, then ou find the absolute value of the difference of each
|1-3|=2
|2-3|=1
|3-3|=0
|4-3|=1
|5-3|=2
add them and divide by 5
(2+1+0+1+2)/5=6/5= MAD=6/5

basically it tells how spread out the graph is or how close the points are to the mean
so the smaller mean average deviation, the closer the points are to the mean
the bigger it is, the farther they are

so if they had the points 1,2,3,4,5 and mean is 3 and MAD=6/5, 6/5 is small so therefor the points are close to that number
if I had the points 1,1,1,2,5,5 and the mean was 3 and MAD=11/5, 11/5 is bigger than 6/5 and therefor the points are more spread out


therefor the math scores are closer togeher
science is farther apart

if you mean that the highest grade in math was compared witht eh highest grade in science, then science is higher since the plots are more spread out

since math had a smaller MAD than science, the points are closer together

"Read the myth below and answer the question that follows. ""Apollo and Daphne"" Daphne was Apollo's first love. It was not brought about by accident, but by the malice of Cupid. Apollo saw the boy playing with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated with his recent victory over Python, he said to him, ""What have you to do with warlike weapons, saucy boy? Leave them for hands worthy of them. Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain! Be content with your torch, child, and kindle up your flames, as you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my weapons."" Venus's boy heard these words, and rejoined, ""Your arrows may strike all things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike you."" So saying, he took his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew from his quiver two arrows of different workmanship, one to excite love, the other to repel it. The former was of gold and sharp pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead. With the leaden shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart. Forthwith the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she abhorred the thought of loving. Her delight was in woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase. Many lovers sought her, but she spurned them all, ranging the woods, and taking no thought of Cupid nor of Hymen. Her father often said to her, ""Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law; you owe me grandchildren."" She, hating the thought of marriage as a crime, with her beautiful face tinged all over with blushes, threw her arms around her father's neck, and said, ""Dearest father, grant me this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Diana."" He consented, but at the same time said, ""Your own face will forbid it."" Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her; and he who gives oracles to all the world was not wise enough to look into his own fortunes. He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders, and said, ""If so charming in disorder, what would it be if arranged?"" He saw her eyes bright as stars; he saw her lips, and was not satisfied with only seeing them. He admired her hands and arms, naked to the shoulder, and whatever was hidden from view he imagined more beautiful still. He followed her; she fled, swifter than the wind, and delayed not a moment at his entreaties. ""Stay,"" said he, ""daughter of Peneus; I am not a foe. Do not fly me as a lamb flies the wolf, or a dove the hawk. It is for love I pursue you. You make me miserable, for fear you should fall and hurt yourself on these stones, and I should be the cause. Pray run slower, and I will follow slower. I am no clown, no rude peasant. Jupiter is my father, and I am lord of Delphos and Tenedos, and know all things, present and future. I am the god of song and the lyre. My arrows fly true to the mark; but, alas! an arrow more fatal than mine has pierced my heart! I am the god of medicine, and know the virtues of all healing plants. Alas! I suffer a malady that no balm can cure! The nymph continued her flight, and left his plea half uttered. And even as she fled she charmed him. The wind blew her garments, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her. The god grew impatient to find his wooings thrown away, and, sped by Cupid, gained upon her in the race. It was like a hound pursuing a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, while the feebler animal darts forward, slipping from the very grasp. So flew the god and the virgin—he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear. The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and his panting breath blows upon her hair. Her strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls upon her father, the river god: ""Help me, Peneus! open the earth to enclose me, or change my form, which has brought me into this danger!"" Scarcely had she spoken, when a stiffness seized all her limbs; her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became leaves; her arms became branches; her foot stuck fast in the ground, as a root; her face became a tree-top, retaining nothing of its former self but its beauty. Apollo stood amazed. He touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark. He embraced the branches, and lavished kisses on the wood. The branches shrank from his lips. ""Since you cannot be my wife,"" said he, ""you shall assuredly be my tree. I will wear you for my crown; I will decorate with you my harp and my quiver; and when the great Roman conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to the Capitol, you shall be woven into wreaths for their brows.

"Which sentences in this excerpt from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Four Freedoms” speech suggest that going to war will result in a peaceful political system?

The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—anywhere in the world.


That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.


To that new order we oppose the greater conception—the moral order. A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear.

Since the beginning of our American history, we have been engaged in change—in a perpetual peaceful revolution—a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions—without the concentration camp or the quick-lime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society.


This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women; and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God. Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is our unity of purpose. To that high concept there can be no end save victory.",English,"
The last sentence is one, but almost the entire excerpt speak of fighting and winning to get that ideal political situation. This excerpt is all about the freedom from fear. That sounds like a call to arms, an encouragement to overcome fear and fight. The sentences leading to the last talks about how maintaining freedom involves fighting for it, and that the only way to stop the struggle (for human rights) is to win that fight.

"After 5.75 hours, Kyler had finished painting 62.5% of his house. He needs to paint a total of 4,000 square feet on his house. At what rate, in square feet per hour, does he paint",Mathematics,"
First, we are going to find the painted area of his house. We know that the total area he needs to paint is 4000 square meters, so 4000 is the area of this house. Now, to find the 62.5% of that area, we are going to multiply it by :
Painted area= 

Now, to find rate, in square feet per hour, we are going to divide the painted area by the number of hours:

"""Knowing how to use fire may have helped the early humans who left Africa 50,000 to 60,000 years ago to cope with colder conditions in Europe. It may also have given them a big advantage over the resident Neanderthals they encountered. By 35,000 years ago the Neanderthals, a sub-species of human whose own origins were in Africa, were mostly extinct."" From The Telegraph, Article on Stone Age humans (2009). Which of the following claims about hominids would this passage provide evidence for?",History,"
Let us go over every choice:
D) D is incorrect; Neanderthals were a hominid species and a relatively advanced one since they lived very closely in time to homo sapiens (modern man). Neanderthals used to live in Europe and had been living there before modern man came from Africa.
C) This is not precise. While it could have been used as a weapon, nowhere in the passage can we see a hint for that. It might have helped modern humans in other ways, making them more reliably survive cold periods and thus displacing the resident Neanderthals.
B) This is also not precise. While the passage implies that fire might have been an important factor for the migration, quite possibly there could be other important aspects of migration to learn. Also, the passage says ""may have helped"", it is not too definitive.
A) THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. The only concrete fact of the passage is the fact that Neandertals went extinct after the arrival of the modern man. The passage in whole is arguing that since fire is so important in Europe and the Neanderthals did not have access to it, we could attribute their extinction to the modern humans having fire as a competitive advantage.

"Within days of the fall of Fort Sumter,1 four more states joined the Confederacy: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.2 The battle lines were now drawn.

On paper, the Union outweighed the Confederacy in almost every way. Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 Northern states. The South claimed just 9 million people — including 3.5 million slaves — in Confederate states. Despite the North’s greater population, however, the South had an army almost equal in size during the first year of the war.

The North had an enormous industrial advantage as well. At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. But that statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North manufactured 97 percent of the country’s firearms, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes. The North had twice the density of railroads per square mile. There was not even one rifleworks3 in the entire South.

All of the principal ingredients of gunpowder were imported.4 Since the North controlled the navy, the seas were in the hands of the Union. A blockade5 could suffocate the South. Still, the Confederacy was not without resources and willpower.
THE SUBTLE STRENGTH OF THE SOUTH
The South could produce all the food it needed, though transporting it to soldiers and civilians was a major problem. The South also had a great nucleus6 of trained officers. Seven of the eight military colleges in the country were in the South.

The South also proved to be very resourceful. By the end of the war, it had established armories7 and foundries in several states. They built huge gunpowder mills and melted down thousands of church and plantation bells for bronze to build cannons.

The South’s greatest strength lay in the fact that it was fighting on the defensive in its own territory. Familiar with the landscape, Southerners could harass Northern invaders.
THE UNCERTAINTIES OF WAR
The military and political objectives of the Union were much more difficult to accomplish. The Union had to invade, conquer, and occupy8 the South. It had to destroy the South’s capacity and will to resist — a formidable9 challenge in any war.

Southerners enjoyed the initial advantage of morale:10 The South was fighting to maintain its way of life, whereas the North was fighting to maintain a union. Slavery did not become a moral cause of the Union effort until Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863.11

When the war began, many key questions were still unanswered. What if the slave states of Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and Delaware had joined the Confederacy? What if Britain or France had come to the aid of the South? What if a few decisive early Confederate victories had turned Northern public opinion against the war?

Indeed, the North looked much better on paper. But many factors undetermined at the outbreak of war could have tilted the balance sheet toward a different outcome.

It takes 1.58 seconds.

The equation to represent this is of the form h(t) = -16t²+v₀t+h₀, where -16 is the gravitational constant, v₀ is the initial velocity, and h₀ is the initial height.  We do not have an initial velocity, since the balloon is dropped.  The initial height is 40.  This gives us the function
h(t) = -16t² + 40.

We will set this equal to 0:
0 = -16t² + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides:
0-40 = -16t² + 40 - 40
-40 = -16t²

Divide both sides by -16:
-40/-16 = -16t²/-16
2.5 = t²

Take the square root of both sides:

Which theme of the jazz age is most present in the first five chapters of the great gatsby,English,"
Materialism

It is clear that what is most important to many characters in the novel is what money can buy them. The reader sees this not only with Gatsby, who throws his party so that Daisy one day will hopefully walk in and be impressed with his things, but with other characters too. The owl-eyed man in Gatsby's library is so impressed that the books are real! Tom buys a puppy for Myrtle and also feels a bit like he owns her. This obsession with 'things' was very prevalent in the 1920s all around.

. . . Wherever they went, the Moslems brought with them their love of art, beauty, and learning.
From about the eighth to the eleventh century, their culture was superior in many ways to that
of western Christendom.
Some of the finest centers of Moslem life were established in Spain. In Cordova, the streets
were solidly paved, while at the same time in Paris people waded ankle-deep in mud after a rain.
Cordovan public lamps lighted roads for as far as ten miles; yet seven hundred years later there
was still not a single public lamp in London!
Some Spanish Moslems had homes with marble balconies and courts with lovely waterfalls.
Bedrooms were vaulted with stained glass and speckled with gold. And metal pipes carried water
into marble baths.
Nearly every mosque had a public school in which the children of the poor were taught. Many
Moslem libraries were excellent; the catalogue of one caliph’s library filled forty volumes. In

Explosions. Car chases. A man and woman, drenched in sweat, limping from a building as it crumbles to the ground, muster the last of their strength to rescue humanity from its inevitable extinction at the cold, metal hands of humanoid creatures with artificial intelligence gone awry. For decades, books and movies have dictated how we think of robots. Simply the word ""robot"" can bring to mind images of evil, mechanical creatures bent on taking over the world and wiping out every glimmer of humanity. And yet, the truth of machines is dramatically different. Today's robots hold little in common with their villainous cousins from action-packed science fiction. Most robots have no interest in harming the human population at all; they exist to aid people in making life safer, healthier, and more productive.
For example, jobs such as welding and painting are important to civilization as we know it, but experience has taught us that these activities can be hazardous to human health. In addition, fumes in automobile and airplane factories can harm organic bodies that become exposed to their toxins in the assembly process. Even when the best precautions are taken, workers may still suffer from lack of adequate ventilation. What is the answer to these difficult dilemmas? Robots. Because machines don't rely on clean air or comfortable temperatures, because they can function even in the midst of deadly gasses, they can take over with ease where humans would suffer greatly. Working together, humans and robots can get the job done. 
A robot's job isn't limited to the terrestrial level, either. Even in space, machines such as the R2 humanoid robot at the International Space Station complete dangerous tasks for astronauts, protecting them from potentially deadly situations. And then, when there are mundane but essential tasks to conduct on the space station, R2 takes care of those, as well, freeing up the astronauts' time for more important responsibilities. Thus, in space and on Earth, robots manage to create healthier, happier humans.
In fact, there are robots on Earth that exist specifically to boost human health. Just as contact lenses enhance human sight, robotics can increase human mobility. People with disabilities and various forms of paralysis now have hope that they can achieve better range of motion, when before this wasn't possible. With the help of robots, scientists are working to create an exoskeleton that will attach itself to the outside of the human body, establishing a connection to the human brain. Neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis has a dream. ""We are working with the Brazilian government, who is helping fund the project. At the 2014 soccer World Cup celebrations we hope to have a Brazilian teenager with quadriplegia walk out and make the opening kick."" 
Explosions and car crashes may sell tickets for the summer blockbuster, but robots have so much more to offer, and much of it is positive service to humans. At the heart of the field of robotics is not the creation of people-destroying machines with evil artificial intelligence, but something much more useful. Robots aren't our enemies; instead, they are the valuable result of scientific endeavors to create safer lives for people everywhere.

"Acupuncture is an alternative medicine that uses wire-thin needles inserted by a trained practitioner into specific points in the body. This ancient form of pain relief and stimulation is said to benefit patients by blocking channels which practitioners claim allow pain to travel within the body. This practice became more widely recognized and used after a New York Times reporter wrote in 1971 of a positive experience with it after surgery. Those who doubt the effectiveness of this treatment for pain attribute the pain relief to a placebo effect: if a patient believes something will reduce their pain, they will experience some relief. The National Institutes of Health says that acupuncture relieves pain and reduces nausea and vomiting, although it is unclear how it works. The few adverse effects reported are due to improperly sterilized needles or improper delivery, making this still a fairly low risk option. For anyone considering acupuncture, they should first research its effectiveness for their specific condition. Summary of statements published by the National Institutes of Health After reading the passage about acupuncture, identify which scientific claim explains why some people say acupuncture does not truly relieve pain.",Biology,"""Those who doubt the effectiveness of this treatment for pain attribute the pain relief to a placebo effect: if a patient believes something will reduce their pain, they will experience some relief.""

How does object-oriented programming work in Python?,Computers and technology,"
So basically you have a class, and within that class you have methods and instance variables; very much like how object oriented programming works in other languages. However, the main difference is that the class constructor in Python is defined right within the class object and is denoted by the method name, ""__init__"" and requires a parameter of ""self"". 
Ex:
class Py:
    def __init__(self):
          constructor code...
The __init__ method is what is called first when an object of the class is instantiated. The way you instantiate an object is by the following:
object_name = Py()

If you wanted to make your class more useful, you could add more parameters to your __init__ constructor, so when an object is created you can pass arguments to that object:
class Py:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
         self.name = name
         self.age = age
         print ""Your name is %s and you are %d years old"" % (name, age)
def main():
     Bob = Py(""Bob"", 23)
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
     main()

This code would give you: Your name is Bob and you are 23 years old

His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates. But Tom's influence among these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a superior being. He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such marvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! Tom's remarks, and Tom's performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and these, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a most gifted and extraordinary creature. Full-grown people brought their perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions. In fact he was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family—these, only, saw nothing in him. Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! He was the prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords and ladies in waiting, and the royal family. Daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council,and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.

Charles Schenck was a Socialist Party leader in the US who opposed US participation in World War I.  He mailed pamphlets to men who'd been drafted that said the government had no right to send American citizens to war to kill people in other countries.  Schenck was convicted of violating the Espionage Act, which had been passed by Congress in 1917.

Schenck appealed his case to the Supreme Court, saying the Espionage Act was unconstitutional.   In the 1919 decision in Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction against Schenck.  Thus the Court essentially upheld the constitutionality of the Espionage Act at that time, saying that in wartime the government has extra responsibility to protect the safety of the nation.  The decision, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, said, ""The question in every case is whether the words are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.""

The coil is initially perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, so the initial flux through it is given by the product between the magnetic field strength and the area of the coil:

The doctrines he laid down in his famous book, ""The Almagest,"" prevailed throughout those ages. No substantial addition was made in all that time to the undoubted truths which this work contained. No important correction was made of the serious errors with which Ptolemy's theories were contaminated.

"Urgent!! Need an answer ASAP! 
Professor Scott has 84 students in his college mathematics lecture class. The scores on the midterm exam are normally distributed with a mean of 72.3 and a standard deviation of 8.9. How many students in the class can be expected to receive a score between 63.4 and 81.2? Express the answer to the nearest student.",Mathematics,"Answer: 57

=====================================================

Explanation:

Convert each raw score to a z score
If x = 63.4, then
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (63.4-72.3)/8.9
z = -1

if x = 81.2, then 
z = (x-mu)/sigma
z = (81.2-72.3)/8.9
z = 1

So P(63.4 < x < 81.2) is the same as P(-1 < z < 1)

Through the empirical rule (aka the 68-95-99.7 rule), we know that roughly 68% of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean. In other words
P(-1 < z < 1) = 0.68 approximately (see note below)

Multiply 0.68 by the total 84 to get
0.68*84 = 57.12
which rounds to 57 people

Note: we can use a calculator to get a more accurate result of 0.68268949; a data table works as well but it won't be as accurate. For the purposes of this problem, the value 0.68 is good enough

Anatomical And Embryonic Evidence Of Evolution

Introduction to Evidence for Evolution

Comparing the anatomy of different species is one major type of evidence for evolution. The main areas of comparative anatomy are anatomical and embryonic evidence.

Anatomical- bone structure

Embryonic- development of unborn organisms


Anatomical Evidence

Anatomical evidence compares the bones structures of various species.
Types of structures:

Homologous- same structure, different function

Analogous - same function, different structure

Vestigial - no function, leftover from ancestor


Embryonic Evidence

Embryos are unborn, developing organisms that often look very different in adult form. Many different species have similar looking embryos, which means early traits are shared between many species. The conclusion is evolutionary relatedness.

We can model both planets as a sphere.
 We have then:
 For the earth:
 v1 = (4/3) * (pi) * (r1 ^ 3)
 v1 = (4/3) * (pi) * ((3960) ^ 3)
 For Jupiter:
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * (r2 ^ 3)
 v2 = (4/3) * (pi) * ((44423) ^ 3)
 Dividing both equations we have:
 v2 / v1 = ((44423) ^ 3) / ((3960) ^ 3)
 v2 / v1 = 1411.685958
 Rounding off we have:
 v2 = 1412v1

Gold Teeth sobbed her assent; and her body squabbered and shook as she confessed the whole story of her trafficking with Christianity. We listened in astonishment and shame. We didn't know that a good Hindu, and a member of our family, could sink so low. Gold Teeth beat her breast and pulled ineffectually at her long hair and begged to be forgiven.

""It is all my fault,"" she cried. ""My own fault, Ma. I fell in a moment of weakness. Then I just couldn't stop.""

My grandmother's shame turned to pity. ""It's all right, Gold Teeth. Perhaps it was this you needed to bring you back to your senses.""

"(1) Earth's crust is made up of relatively rigid plates that ride atop Earth's hot, semiliquid mantle. (2) The plates are called tectonic because they're in constant motion. (3) They can move because Earth's mantle is a very hot and semiliquid fluid called magma. (4) Volcanoes are a result of magma rising up or erupting through a plate, particularly where plate boundaries are moving against each other. (5) Also, when plates slide against each other, causing friction along adjacent plate boundaries, earthquakes frequently occur. (6) Therefore, we often find volcanoes and earthquakes along plate boundaries. (7) Plates may also collide. (8) When that happens, mountain ranges are formed.

This membrane envelops the mitochondrial matrix, where the electrons are produced (the citric acid cycle) and then travel from one protein complex to the next in the inner membrane (electron transport chain). The final electron acceptor is O2, and this ultimately forms H2O. At the same time, the electron transport chain produces ATP (oxidative phosphorylation via ATP synthase). ATP synthase uses concentration gradient of H+ (formed during electron transport), power synthesis of the energy molecule-ATP.

Read the following quotation. Helping others is the key to happiness. Think carefully about this statement. Write an essay explaining your own ideas about the key to happiness. Be sure to— clearly state your thesis organize and develop your ideas effectively choose your words carefully edit your writing for grammar, mechanics, and spelling",English,"
To my opinion, the key to happiness is inside all of us.
First of all, happiness comes from inside, and even if it could depend on exterior factors, we will not be happy unless we know where to find it. Most of us think that if we buy what we wish the most, or if we are rich, we are happy. But it is just a misconception. Happiness does not depend on objects, but on feelings.
Secondly, happiness is just like a locked door. To find the key to it, we find the door first, and to do that, we just need to know ourselves better. To help people, and by seeing their smiles, we will feel a warmth inside. That is happiness. 
There is not just one key - people are all different, and each of them has a different key, a different purpose, and a different door to open.
Happiness is a choice. And when we realise this, we are very close to find its key too.
To sum up, I would say that all we have to do in order to find the key to happiness is to open our eyes properly, and to see what the majority cannot see.

A linocut is a type of relief print. Relief printing is when a piece of paper is “stamped” with ink from the top surface of the plate.
Other types of relief prints are woodcuts and engraving. Essentially, a linocut is the same as a woodcut but the plate isn’t wood, it’s a piece of linoleum, and because of the softness of the plate, it is easier to carve.
When you carve your lino you are cutting away the area that will be white and leaving the area that will be black (or coloured if you are printing in colour). Linocuts were originally made popular by Picasso, while before that they were simply regarded as a student’s medium to practise for woodcuts.

"Read the excerpt below from the introduction to the book Access to the Genome: The Challenge to Equality and answer the questions that follow. 


As genetic technology and other technologies relevant to human biology are developed, society will face a host of complex ethical, legal, and social issues. One of the most complex sets of issues involves our choices over who will have access to these technologies. . . . If, indeed, diseases can be cured or prevented, and if embryos can be selected or enhanced, but the technologies are not available for all to have [due to affordability], how will our society respond? What does justice require, and what will political realities permit?

The issues surrounding how to distribute access to new genetic technologies are the focus of this book. These questions and problems are not new—we struggle now with the fair allocation of vital health care resources in a society marked by great discrepancies in wealth. But genetic technologies will dramatically up the ante as the menu of powerful possibilites expands. With the possible exception of slavery, these technologies represent the most profound challege to cherished notions of social equality ever encountered. Decisions over who will have access to what genetic technologies will likely determine the kind of society and political system that will prevail in the future.

Before discussing the social and moral issues raised by these questions, we will first provide some background information on the genetic revolution itself. In the next chapter, we describe the massive effort to decode the human genetic recipe. In Chapter Three, we describe the technologies that this effort is likely to produce and the potential benefits that they will provide. Then we will embark on a discussion of the social and ethical problems that these technologies pose and, finally, discuss potential solutions. (Mehlman 6)

"Which lines in this passage are a flashback? Helen stood at one end of the room taking in all the activity; Rupert and Phoebe danced to the loud music that drowned all other voices. Food, friends, music—how they brought people together. She thought of her last day in middle school, seven years ago, when Sarah had given her an iPod. She had felt ecstatic that day when she realized she would be able to listen to her favorite songs and fend off comments from her cousins about how little she knew about music. She smiled as she drew out the envelope from her clutch. Tomorrow at this time she would be performing solo at the Royal Hall of Music; she could almost hear the thunderous applause. The music stopped and Phoebe called out her name. Helen almost dropped the envelope as she walked up to congratulate Phoebe.

Let us think of the classical theory first. In the classical theory, light is a wave that gives energy. This energy gradually helps the electron jump to a higher energy level.
In quantum theory, this is wrong; an electron cannot absorb a small amout of energy because there is not close enough state to jump to with that energy; only very specific amounts of energy lead to a change in orbital levels/ absorbance of energy. Also, each pair of energy levels has a specific energy difference that is needed from an electron so that it can move. 
Hence, B is correct; all other sentences describe classical models of light-electron interactions

"What can carry hundreds of people at speeds of up to 300miles per hour, all without ever touching the ground? Hint: It's not an airplane, and it's definitely not science fiction! This amazing transportation system is called the maglev train.

You may think of trains as being very old-fashioned forms of transportation. It's true that these vehicles were more popular in the early twentieth century and that they largely fell out of favor when automobiles became common. Recently, though, traffic congestion in big cities, rising fuel prices, and concerns about the environment have made many people reconsider trains. Not old-fashioned trains, either—but new, state-of-the-art models that might bring about a transportation revolution.

Worldwide, some of the most promising plans for a high-tech train revolve around the maglev concept. What makes maglev so special? The answer is in its name, which is short for ""magnetic levitation""—""levitation"" means floating in the air.

""Most people think of magnets as tools that are attracted to metal and will grip tightly to any metal surface. That might sound like it would delay, rather than speed up, a moving vehicle. However, sometimes magnetic forces repel each other. If you've ever tried to stick one magnet to another magnet, you may have noticed this phenomenon,"" said scientist Dr. Gregory McHale. ""Under the right circumstances, two magnified surfaces could repel each other and cause one to literally float in the air!""

That is the main scientific idea behind a maglev train. The train actually floats above special magnetic tracks and does not touch the ground at all! This might not seem like a benefit until you consider how traditional trains, as well as most other kinds of wheeled vehicles, work. While the wheels are rolling along rails (or a road), they experience friction, the force of two things rubbing together. ""Friction makes it harder for wheels to move, and causes the vehicle to burn more energy trying to keep its speed. If the vehicle was levitating, however, it would experience no friction at all, and it could move much more quickly and easily,"" said Dr. McHale. The lack of rubbing also means that train and track parts will not wear out nearly as quickly.

The magnetic-levitation system is powered by electricity, considered by many to be a more environmentally friendly substitute for traditional fuels such as gasoline. It would then create less air pollution, as well as less noise pollution, since the engineless train would make little or no sound other than the rush of air.

""In Japan and China, scientists are already taking huge strides in advancing maglev technology. Many other countries, including the United States, are just getting their feet wet with the maglev high-speed train concept,"" said Lachelle Simmons, a transportation analyst. ""The major sticking point, though, is the start-up cost. It would cost many billions of dollars to establish a maglev train system in the United States. That money is badly needed elsewhere. On top of that, there is no guarantee of a return on the investment. Nobody is sure Americans would be willing to give up their cars and start regularly riding the train.""

The future of maglev train technology holds a great deal of promise but also uncertainty. Only time will tell if this new form of transportation will become a major part of American life. If it does, keep your eyes open for a lightning-fast flash of color and a rush of air—you might have just spotted a maglev!

How far horizontally from the starting point will the rock land? Round to the nearest hundredth.,Mathematics,"
The answer is 57.04 meters. 
Solution:
The height y of the rock above the ground as a function of the horizontal distance x from the starting point on top of the hill can be modeled by the equation 
     y = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

We now set this equation equal to zero because the height of the ground where the rock will land is zero:
     0 = -0.04x^2 + 1.3x + 56

Since we have a quadratic equation, we can calculate for the horizontal distance x by using the quadratic formula     
     x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a      
     x = {-1.3 ± sqrt[1.3^2 - 4(-0.04)(56)]} / 2(-0.04)     
     x = (-1.3 ± sqrt(10.65)) / (-0.08)     
     x =  -24.54 meters or  57.04 meters
There are two solutions for x but one is negative, so we choose the positive value.

I'm struggling with the wording of the second choice. My background is physics and most of the people I know are dumbfounded by the vastness of space, the laws that govern physics, and the beauty and simplicity of the way the universe explains itself. I have met people who do not agree with my assessment of the Universe, but they are in the minority and they are not fools for declining to agree. 

I am trying to say that Religion and Science can coexist and many people feel this coexistence to be true without question. People pray for example who also manipulate complex mathematical ideas. We don't choose conflict without reason, but coexistence is always possible. It only takes men and women of good will to make it work.

If you confront someone right off the bat since you think they are talking to someone who talks about you behind your back or they are dating your boyfriend or your boyfriend is dating someone else behind your back don't confront. Trick them into telling you what they are doing or follow them and catch them in the act so they have no chance in saying that they didn't do it. Confrontation can lead to them lying to you. Sometimes you might be wrong and when you confront them and find out that it really wasn't what they were doing, they get mad and decide that they are going to leave you or are not going to talk to you. Or maybe they decide that they are going to forget about it and then confront you with something and let you feel the hurt and pain that that brings to a person.

A single memorable day in my life

When I was 8 years of age, I went to my grandmother’s house , I remember seeing a dark black vehicle parked outside of her house, it was the most beautiful car I had ever seen, black leather interior with shinny details like on the radio part of it and how can I forget the tires. They were so big and clean I just kept thinking “how I wish I could drive one like that”! I asked my parents if they knew what type of vehicle it was unfortunately they were not into cars and were too busy to even look at the vehicle and give me a response, it didn’t matter, I took a memory picture and it kept it for many years to come. 
I remember that when I left my grandma’s house the car was no longer there, I kept wondering who did that car belonged to. I mean, after all everyone who lived in that area were not wealthy and most of them didn’t even owned a car. Maybe a guest I that comes to visit someone around there I thought to myself. The following weekend came and it was time to visit to visit my grandma again, I remember this time I went with my older brother who at the time was 22, I drove him crazy about the car I had seen, so much so to the point that he agreed to come along with us. 
As we get o my grandma’s house I see the beautiful black car parked on the same saw it parked the weekend before, It is a CHEVY! My brother scream, it is a beautiful black Chevy! Almost looks brand new! Wow! He was as shocked as me and so both of us kept on drooling over the car. My brother walked around the car admiring it over and over! When all of the sudden we hear a deep voice asking “are you guys looking for something”? Immediately we backed up and said ...”No. No sir! Just looking at the car it looks like those on the action movies! The guy approached us and asked us if we wanted to sit inside the car! Of course we said yes. As the time went by, my older brother askes the guy how he could afford such a car, he explained to us that he brought it crashed and almost destroyed for pennies, eventually and little by little he was able to buy the parts and fix it on its own. 
My brother and I looked at each other and I knew it was the beginning of something, my brother told me that night that he would be doing the same, and he would start saving as much as he could and will buy a vehicle and little by little fix it. It seem so much easier and less expensive but we had no experienced on mechanics, all we need was collecting car toys. A year after that my bother purchased a Volkswagen beetle, it didn’t drive but it was all we could afford $100. We pushed the car to our house and it want until 3 years after that we were able to get it back like new. It drove, looked nice and we sold it for much more than $100. 
With that money, we were able to continue doing so, we grew and decided to open a small company where we sold used cars to people with low income. It got to the point where we had almost 2 to 3 cars parked outside the house.
People would come and ask us for more cars. It got a little bit crazy, but with my father and my mother’s help we manage to keep the company running. After 8 years of continuing work, my brother and my parents took me out to eat to this fancy restaurant, we were all very happy of spending time together and enjoying the fruits of our small company, but it wasn’t until it was time to leave when I felt real happiness. 
My brother said to me, well Diego it is time for you to start practicing your driving skills so you will be driving back home this time, I said okay. It was not the first time that I drove so I found it weird of him to have such an emphasis on his comment. As I walk out of the restaurant with my parents and my brother I couldn’t believe what I was seeing! The same black Chevy I saw when I was 8 years old at my grandma’s house.

Your set is 2, 5 and 8.

In order to calculate the standard deviation, first, you need to calculate the mean of the scores:
m = (2 + 5 + 8) / 3

    = 5

Then, find the variance: subtract the mean from each value, square the results, sum them up and divide it by the number of scores.
(2 - 5)² = 9
(5 - 5)² = 0
(8 - 5)² = 9
Therefore:
v = (9 + 0 + 9) / 3 
   = 18 / 3
   = 6

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

Ploughing and turning over the soil aerates the soil so the roots of plants are able to thrive well. Ploughing the roots of leguminous plants back to the soil returns nutritents and organic matter to the soil organically rather than using synthetic fertilisers which are potentially hazardous to the environment.

(provide some specific examples why were the cities of milan, florence and venice so wealthy during the 1400 and 1500s? how did this help promote the renaissance? how did the medici family get so rich, powerful and famous? besides trade, what role did the muslim world play in helping start the renaissance? what was john greene's main point in his argument that the renaissance did not occur? do you agree or disagree with his argument?",History,"
The Renaissance scholars were much interested in reviving the classical era of Greek and Roman culture.   These areas of culture were revived in the visual arts and in architecture.  The humanists of the Renaissance studied Greek and Roman writings, focused on the ""humanities"" such as philosophy and history.  (Today we also call such studies the ""liberal arts."")

The Renaissance happened across Europe, but was sparked by affluent city-states in Italy.  These city-states were wealthy from products they made and some became very rich through trade and commerce.  Wealthy persons in the Italian cities were sponsors of art and architecture and liberal studies, thus promoting the culture of the Renaissance.  Much of this wealth came from trading with the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire, so there was an indirect role of Muslims in the support of the Renaissance.  The Medici family were granted permission from the pope for exclusive rights to alum trade with the Ottomans, thus enriching and empowering the Medici.    When the Ottomans took over sections of the old Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantine scholars fled to Italy, which also spurred the Renaissance movement in Italy.  Another way Muslims were in the background of Renaissance thought was how Muslim scholarship in math and science filtered over into European scholarship.

John Green, in Crash Course, argues against the ""Renaissance"" as a thing because the art and learning was only experienced at the top of society.  The vast majority of Europeans still lived on farms and were not well educated.  Most Europeans didn't encounter the Renaissance's pattern of thought during that time.  We remember it because of the ideas that came from it that are important to us now.  The Renaissance is more of a construct we have made out of various things that happened over a span of centuries.

As to whether or not you agree with Green's argument, that's up to you.

some disadvantages: the side effects go GMOs are unknown so many people do not want to consume produce that has been genetically engineered.

"A 2.5% (by mass) solution concentration signifies that there is of solute in every 100 g of solution. 2. therefore, when 2.5% is expressed as a ratio of solute mass over solution mass, that mass ratio would be . 3. a solution mass of 1 kg is times greater than 100 g, thus one kilogram (1 kg) of a 2.5% ki solution would contain of ki.",Chemistry,"
Answer #1 is ""there is 2.5 grams of solute in every 100 g of solution."" 
We calculate for 2.5% by mass solution by dividing the mass of the solute by the mass of the solution and then multiply by 100.
Answer #2 is ""that mass ratio would be 2.5/100 or 2.5 grams of solute/100 grams of solution."" 
We weigh out 2.5 grams of solute and then add 97.5 grams of solvent to make a total of 100 gram solution, that is,
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g solute / (2.5g solute + 97.5g solvent)
                                                          = 2.5g solute / 100g solution
Answer#3 is ""a solution mass of 1 kg is 10 times greater than 100 g, thus one kilogram (1 kg) of a 2.5% ki solution would contain 25 grams of ki.""
We multiply 10 to each mass so that 100 grams becomes 1000grams since 1000 grams is equal to 1 kg:
     mass of solute / mass of solution = 2.5g*10/[(2.5g*10) + (97.5g*10)]
                                                          = 25g solute/(25g solute + 975g solvent)
                                                          = 25g solute/1000g solution
                                                          = 25g solute/1kg solution

11.Allergic rhinitis is also known as hay fever. It is an inflammation in the nose which happens when the immune system overreacts to the allergens found in the air. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes and sometimes swelling. 

The answer is B.

12. Urticaria is also known as hives. It is a type of skin rash that is usually raised, red, itchy and bumpy. It is also known as weals, welts, or nettle rash. It can range from the size of just a few millimeters to the size of a hand. 

The answer is C.

13. Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. The condition that is more common in children but it can still occur at any age. You can have eczema along with asthma or hay fever. It turns the skin red and itchy. 

The answer is D.

14. Hives are often triggered by infection, certain foods or medications. They are also triggered by insect stings and bites. Sometimes even environmental conditions can trigger them like heat, cold, pressure and sun exposure. 

The answer is True.

15. Sinusitis is the acute or chronic inflammation of the cavities around the nasal passages or what you call sinuses. Inflammation can persist up to 12 weeks even when being treated. The inflammation interferes with drainage so the mucus builds up in the passages. 

16.  Allergy shots or vaccinations are more professionally known as immunotherapy. These shots help  the body get used to the allergens or the things that trigger an allergic reaction. They are not a cure, but they help your system to adjust to the allergen. 

The answer is D.

17. Mold and mildew are examples of fungi. They are related to plants but more closely related to animals. Other fungi include mushrooms, yeasts, smuts, and rusts. 

The answer is A.

18. ""Seeds"" of molds are called spores. They also form some plants, algae, fungi and protozoans. It is a unit of reproduction and may be sexual or asexual. Most fungal spores are made for airborne dispersal. 

19. Exposure to mold puts a person at greater risk of developing allergies. Any exposure to allergens can trigger allergic reactions. Another risk factor is history of asthma, family history of allergies or asthma and even age.

The answer is True. 

20. Fungi can grow in the human body. Examples of which are yeast infections. Yeast infections can grow on skin which cause a red itchy rash. Fungal infections are often caused bu fungi that are already available or common in the environment.

Which of the following adaptations best helps polar bears walk on snow?

The answer is Process 1 describes artificial selection and process 2 describes genetic engineering. Artifical selection involves the artificial breeding of two or more species and selecting the desired traits. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genetic material  of an organism of a species to achieve desired  characteristics.
 
Question 17;
The answer is Both characteristics represent meiosis. This is a type of cell cycle that occurs in the gonads of organisms in the process of formation of gametes. The gametes cells have half the genetic material as the pre-gamete cells/or   somatic cells. For example, humans cells, that are usually diploid, are halved in meiosis to make gamete cell haploid.   Meiosis I halve the genetic material while meiosis II is similar to mitosis that duplicates.
 
Question 18;
  R R r Rr Rr r Rr RrThe answer is 4 red : 0 white
This is because the question asks for phenotypic ratio which is the morphology.  As shown in the punnet square, all the offspring will be heterozygous for the color, but since Red is dominant over white, all the offspring will exhibit the red color.
 
Question 19;
The answer is Heat water and records its change in temperature with time. This relates to the first law of thermodynamics, which stipulates on the law of conservation of energy.  Therefore when energy is put into a system, the system is expected to do work (in this case is the increase in temperatures).
 
Question 1;
The answer is The pea plant received different alleles from both parents. During the fusion of gametes from male and female, the haploid cells of the gametes fuse to form a haploid zygote. This zygote has alleles from both parents on virtually all genes. The dominant allele shows in the phenotype.
Question 2;
The answer is 25%This is because cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic disorder will only show in the offspring if they are recessive for both alleles in the gene for cystic fibrosis. The offspring that are heterozygous for the disease will show no symptoms because the dominant alleles mask the effect of the recessive allele.
 
Question 3;
  Y y y Yy Yy y Yy yy 
 
According to the statement, Yellow color is dominant over the green, because in the heterozygous plant, the yellow color masks the green color. Therefore, based on the punnet square above, 50% of the offspring will be yellow (heterozygous) and the other 50% will be green (homozygous recessive).
 
 
Question 4;
Damage to marine flora and fauna due to oil spills could be prevented. In case of an oil spill, the genetically-engineered pseudomonas bacteria will be able to break down the oil particles and convert them to biomolecules. This will remove the oil before it does more harm to an ecosystem.
 
Question 5;
They have Furry feet. This is one of the adaptations of the polar bears have to ensure that they survive the harsh cold climate of the Arctic region. They also have wide feet to reduce the pressure on their weight on the ice and therefore good for movement on the ice, especially thin ice

Gabriela owns a company that makes silk scarves. She buys the silk from an overseas supplier and is subject to a tax on imported goods. Gabriela most likely lives in a mixed market economy with some government regulation.

A mixed economic system features characteristics of both capitalism and socialism. A mixed economic system protects private property and allows a level of economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims. According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets, but proponents of government interventions argue that the base conditions such as equal information and rational market participants cannot be achieved in practical application.

(a) at an interest rate of 12% per year, which model should the consulting firm buy? conduct an annual worth analysis. (b) what are the pw values for each vehicle?",Business,"
Part (a): Annual worthy analysis
Annual worthy = -Annuities  of PV (cost) - Annual expenses + Annuities of FV (salvage cost)

Then,
For GM model:
Annual worthy = -36,000(A|P,12%,3) -4000 + 15,000(A|F,12%,3)
Where,
(A|P,12%,3) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12}^-1 = 0.41635;
(A|F,12%,3) = {[(1+0.12)^3-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.29635
Therefore,
Annual worthy for GM model = -36,000(0.41635) - 4,000 + 15,000(0.29635) = -$50,543.35

For Ford model:
Annual worthy = -32,000(A|P,12%,4) - 4,100 + 15,000(A|F,12%,4)
Where,
(A|P,12%,4) = {[1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12}^-1 = 0.32923
(A|F,12%,2) = {[(1+0.12)^4-1]/0.12}^-1 = 0.20923
Therefore,
Annual worthy of Ford model = -32,000(0.32923) - 4,100 + 15,000 (0.20923) = -$11,496.91

It can be noted that Annual worth of Ford > Annual worthy of GM model and thus the best option is the Ford model

Part (b): Present Worth (PW)
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(P/A,12%,3) + 15,000(P/F,12%,3)
Where
(P/A,12%,3) = [1-(1+0.12)^-3]/0.12 = 2.40183
(P/F,12%,3) = 1/(1+0.12)^3 = 0.71178
Therefore,
PW of GM model = -36,000 - 4,000(2.40183) + 15,000 (0.71178) = -$34,930.62

PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(P/A,12%,4) + 15,000(P/F,12%,4)
Where,
(P/A,12%,4) = [1-(1+0.12)^-4]/0.12 = 3.03735
(P/F,12%,4) = 1/(1+0.12)^4 = 0.63552
Therefore,
PW of Ford model = -32,000 - 4,100(3.03735) + 15,000 (0.63552) = -$10,014.065

Based on PW, PW of Ford model > PW for GM model and thus Ford model is the better option.

Total cost is 3,900. 115 x 20 = 2,300.

Two mechanics worked on a car. The first charged $115 per hour and the second charged $80 per hour. The mechanics worked for a combined total of 20 hours and together they charged a total of $1775. How long did each mechanic work ?,Mathematics,"
X= # hours first mechanic worked
y= # hours second mechanic worked

QUANTITY EQUATION 
x + y= 20 hours 

COST EQUATION 
$115x + $80y= $1775


STEP 1:
multiply both sides of cost equation by -115

-115(x + y)= -115(20)
-115x - 115y= -2300


STEP 2:
add quantity equation and equation from step 1 together to solve for y

115x + 80y= 1775
-115x - 115y= -2300
x will cancel out

-35y= -525
divide both sides by -35
y= 15 hours second mechanic worked


STEP 3:
substitute y value in quantity equation to solve for x

x + y= 20
x + 15= 20
subtract 15 from both sides
x= 5 hours first mechanic worked


ANSWER: The first mechanic worked 5 hours and the second mechanic worked 15 hours.
