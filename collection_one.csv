One thing about IDLE that drives me nuts is that when it saves a file, it converts tabs to spaces (you can adjust how many in the prefs). This causes impossible to find indentation errors because several spaces are NOT the same as a tab, but you can't see the difference on the screen.

Species are disappearing at an accelerating rate through human action, primarily habitat destruction but also pollution and the introduction of exotic species into residual natural environments. I have said that a fifth or more of the species of plants and animals could vanish or be doomed to early extinction by the year 2020 unless better efforts are made to save them. . . . As the last forests are felled [destroyed] in forest strongholds like the Philippines and Ecuador, the decline of species will accelerate even more. In the world as a whole, extinction rates are already hundreds or thousands of times higher than before the coming of man. They cannot be balanced by new evolution in any period of time that has meaning for the human race.


Why should we care? What difference does it make if some species are extinguished, if even half of all the species on earth disappear? Let me count the ways. New sources of scientific information will be lost. Vast potential biological wealth will be destroyed. Still undeveloped medicines, crops, pharmaceuticals, timber, fibers, pulp, soil-restoring vegetation, petroleum substitutes, and other products and amenities will never come to light. 


Based on the excerpt, which statement best summarizes the author’s beliefs about the disappearing species?

The loss of plant species and habitats will lead to widespread animal extinction.

The loss of plant species and habitats will lead to environmental problems in remote regions.

The loss of plant species and habitats will displace animals and decrease human wealth.

Read the passage below about acupuncture. 

Acupuncture is an alternative medicine that uses wire-thin needles inserted by a trained practitioner into specific points in the body. This ancient form of pain relief and stimulation is said to benefit patients by blocking channels which practitioners claim allow pain to travel within the body. This practice became more widely recognized and used after a New York Times reporter wrote in 1971 of a positive experience with it after surgery. 

Those who doubt the effectiveness of this treatment for pain attribute the pain relief to a placebo effect: if a patient believes something will reduce their pain, they will experience some relief. The National Institutes of Health says that acupuncture relieves pain and reduces nausea and vomiting, although it is unclear how it works. The few adverse effects reported are due to improperly sterilized needles or improper delivery, making this still a fairly low risk option. For anyone considering acupuncture, they should first research its effectiveness for their specific condition.

A) Social movement
B) Moral panic
C) Social revolution
D) Riot",Social studies,"3.) According to Karl Marx, human history shows that struggle develops between the thesis and its antithesis, leading to a synthesis. Marx called this historical change a ""Dialectical process"".

The dialectical method is a mindset about reality that can be a critical apparatus for uncovering the passing and fleeting nature of a social framework that on occasion - maybe more often than not - has all the earmarks of being a reality as genuine and unfaltering as the floor at the base of the staircase.

8.) During some periods of time, there are very few social movements in society and, at other times, a wave of social movements will emerge. The number of social movements increases ""When a society experiences a cultural crisis"".


A social movement is a vast gathering of individuals who are composed to advance or oppose some social change. A social development is regularly in light of two variables - initially, whom the development is endeavoring to change, and second, how much change a development is upholding. Social developments can happen at the individual level or at the societal level, and they can advocate for either minor or radical changes. 

9.) When missionaries introduced steel axes to the aborigines of Australia, it upset their entire society. This spreading of an invention from one society to another is referred to as ""Diffusion"".


Ogburn's third procedure of social change is diffusion, the spread of innovation or revelation starting with one region then onto the next. Contact between societies is the wellspring of dissemination. Ogburn saw diffusion as the real procedure of social change and contends that it can have far achieving consequences for human connections. 

10.) if a large group of people organized to promote or resist social change, it is involved in a ""Social movement"".


A social development is a sort of gathering activity. Social developments can be characterized as ""hierarchical structures and techniques that may enable mistreated populaces to mount viable difficulties and oppose the all the more intense and advantaged elites"". They are expansive, now and again casual, groupings of people or associations which center around particular political or social issues. ",5,Ambitious,2,2,https://brainly.com/question/9970105,1525457727
